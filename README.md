# Women In GOT
Gender equality is every human's right. But what about the characters in the hit series of Game of thrones. Well, we all know that some of the most powerful characters in GOT happen to be women, but have you really thought about what's the share of screen time between the male and female characters. Over here I have explored whether the scripts for the Game of Thrones season reflected the theme of female empowerment or not. By doing so, I will mainly be addressing the following points:  
• How the dialogue percentage is shared by gender and by character.   
• What are the most common words in each of the top female and male characters scripts.  
• How the screen time is shared by gender and by characters.   
• How has the character development taken place over the seasons based on sentiment analysis, i.e. change of sentiments based on the dialogues  
• Does the killing of characters also addresses gender inequality or is it random. 
 
I am using ggplot2, text mining techniques and network analysis in this visualization. 
 
# Data: 
For the analysis the scripts and the screen time can be collected from: 
 
• Scripts of each episodes from season 1-7 https://genius.com/albums/Game-of-thrones/Season-4-scripts  
• Screen time of each character for the seasons 1-7 https://data.world/aendrew/game-of-thrones-screen-times  
• Deaths of characters https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/game-of-thrones/data
