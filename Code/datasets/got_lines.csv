TYRION,If I were capable of tricking father I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. .
CERSEI,I've done nothing.
TYRION,Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.

CERSEI,One.
TYRION,One?
CERSEI,Arya little animal she disappeared.
TYRION,Disappeared? What in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious.

LORD,The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter. The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers. When I was a boy I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer. Men worked back then. Today
LUWIN,Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.
LORD,Generally yes but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war.
BRAN,King Robb. And it's not his war. He didn't choose it.
LORD,Maybe not My Lord but he called in his Banners
BRAN,Joffrey killed my father your liege lord. Do you remember your vows Ser?
LORD,Of course I remember!
LUWIN,We can spare four masons for a week My Lord. Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?
LORD,I - I believe it will.The man walks away. After a moment Luwin turns to Bran.
LUWIN,We didn't want him here all day did we?
BRAN,I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.
LUWIN,Nor did I. But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. . Lord Portan.

BRAN,Don't have any pain.
OSHA,Lucky for you.
BRAN,That way.Bran points and Hodor changes direction heading for the godswood. Osha turns and begins following them.
OSHA,You've been having those dreams again.
BRAN,I don't dream.
OSHA,Everyone dreams.
BRAN,I don't. Heard some of the men talking about the comet. . They say it's an omen. They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.
OSHA,Did they? . I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. I heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood to mark the death of your father.Osha places Bran on the ground. He begins crawling towards the edge of the pool.

DAENERYS,My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything.Doreah looks down dejectedly. Daenerys gets Drogon off of her shoulder and into his cage. At the front of the group a horse suddenly collapses. Jorah jogs forward to investigate. Daenerys follows after him. Daenerys kneels down to look at the horse. She looks up at Jorah who shakes his head. Daenerys looks down sadly.
DAENERYS,She was Drogo's first gift to me.
JORAH,I remember.
DAENERYS,I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream?
JORAH,A trick I never learned I'm afraid.
DAENERYS,Does it ever end?
JORAH,This is further east than I've ever been. But yes Khaleesi
DAENERYS,And you're sure there's no other way?
JORAH,If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons. If we go west to the Dothraki Sea the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons.
DAENERYS,No one will take my dragons.
JORAH,They are too weak to fight as are your people. You must be their strength.
DAENERYS,As you are mine.Daenerys says something in Dothraki calling Rakharo and some others over. She then stands up and addresses Rakharo and two others.
DAENERYS,Rakharo Aggo Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east
RAKHARO,What do we seek Khaleesi?
DAENERYS,Cities living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us and what lies on the other side.Rakharo and the other two riders walk away. Later

WATCHMAN,Yes commander.
CRASTER,You want to know where they've all gone? North! To join up with Mance Rayder Your old friend.
LORD MORMONT,He's no friend of mine. He broke his vows betrayed his brothers!

DAVOS,Not now.
MELISANDRE,And the dead shall rise in the North.
CRESSEN,. All you men were named in the Light of the Seven! Is this how you treat the Gods of your fathers? Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?After a long silence Melisandre approaches Cressen and caresses his face.
MELISANDRE,You smell of fear fear and piss and old bones. Do you want to stop me? Stop me.After a moment Cressen begrudgingly stands aside.
MELISANDRE,In the ancient books it's written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire. And that sword shall be Lightbringer. Stannis Baratheon warrior of light
CROWD,Lord cast your light upon us!
MELISANDRE,For the night is dark and full of terrors.
STANNIS,For the night is dark and full of terror.Stannis then walks away almost forgetting to bring his wife with him. The rest of the crowd gets up to leave moments later. Davos and Cressen stay behind a moment to talk.
CRESSEN,This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win.
DAVOS,Stannis is our king. We follow where he leads even if we don't like the path.
CRESSEN,King. Since that boar killed his brother every lord wants a coronation.
DAVOS,I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.
CRESSEN,As do I but loyal service means telling hard truths. He's surrounded by fools and fanatics but he trusts you
DAVOS,What's the truth?Cressen looks crestfallen. Davos walks away with the sword. Cressen looks up at the burning effigies.INT. DRAGONSTONE - LATER THAT DAYMatthos reads out a letter for Stannis to proofread as they and some other characters sit around a table.

STANNIS,Make it Ser Jaime Lannister the Kingslayer. Whatever else he is the man's still a knight.
MATTHOS,. Let all true men declare their loyalty.<94>
STANNIS,When Eddard Stark learned the truth he told only me. I'll not make the same mistake. Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm from the Arbor to the Wall. The time has come to choose. Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.
DAVOS,Your Grace the Lannisters are the true enemy. If for the time being
STANNIS,I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King.
DAVOS,Well many have already declared for him; Mace Tyrell Randyll Tarly.
MELISANDRE,Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support. The Lord of Light stands behind him.
DAVOS,And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?
MELISANDRE,He has no need for ships.
DAVOS,I'm sure he doesn't but we do if we're going to war. If not Renly Your Grace

DAVOS,Don't.Cressen stands up with the drugged glass of wine and walks over to where Melisandre is sitting.
CRESSEN,A cup of wine to honor the one true God.Melisandre stands up. Everyone at the table reaches for their own wine glasses. Cressen takes a sip of the drugged wine and offers it to Melisandre. Davos nervously watches her take the glass. Cressen begins to stumble and bleed from his nose. Melisandre drink a large portion of the wine. As he falls to the floor dead Davos and many others stand up. Melisandre appears unphased by the poison.
MELISANDRE,The night is dark and full of terrors old man but the fire burns them all away. Your Grace.CUT TO: NORTHEXT. STARK CAMPThe camera pans over a watchtower to a wide shot of the camp. In the camp
JAIME,King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl.
ROBB,If I left you with one of my bannermen your father would know within a fortnight and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message
JAIME,You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?
ROBB,Oh I trust them with my life. Just not with yours.
JAIME,Smart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called <91>boy? Insulted?Robb looks behind Jaimes cage. As Jaime nervously strains to look behind him Grey Wind can be heard heavily walking to the front of the cage.
ROBB,You insult yourself Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy.With Grey Wind now fully in view Jaime loses his brave facade.
ROBB,You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. . He's your bastard son.
JAIME,If that's true Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him.
ROBB,My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed.
JAIME,I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.
ROBB,Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him. And you... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.
JAIME,You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?
ROBB,I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.
JAIME,You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.
ROBB,No but he's starting to know me.
JAIME,Three victories don't make you a conqueror.
ROBB,It's better than three defeats.Robb nudges Grey Wind towards Jaime and leaves the cage. Grey Wind growls in Jaimes face and comes close to biting him. Jaime closes his eyes in preparation but when he opens them back up Grey Wind is gone.CUT TO: KINGS LANDINGINT. TYRIONS ROOMShae looks out from the balcony in Tyrions room.

TYRION,A bit corpsey yes.
SHAE,And shit.Shae hops down from the balcony and walks back into the room.
TYRION,I thought you wanted to come here.
SHAE,I love it.
TYRION,You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?
SHAE,And cum and garlic and rum.
TYRION,You can smell cum from the balcony?
SHAE,I love the stink. I love the noise. Cities make me want to fuck.
TYRION,And so did the country.Shae lays back on Tyrions bed.
SHAE,This is where I belong.
TYRION,Yes well you need to be careful. No one can know you're here.
SHAE,No one will know.
TYRION,You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars bad liars one or two great liars.
SHAE,What about you?
TYRION,Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.
SHAE,Truth?  You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.
TYRION,Why do you think I am so little? I'm being  crushed beneath the weight of all that truth.
TYRION,Ned Stark actually slept on this as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here.Tyrion and Shae kiss as a bell rings in the distance.INT. HALLWAYA servant boy can be seen scrubbing something on the floor as Baelish walks down a hallway next to a courtyard. Cersei and some kingsguard approach from behind.
CERSEI,Lord Baelish.

CERSEI,I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
BAELISH,Of course Your Grace.
CERSEI,Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her.Baelish begins walking with Cersei and her guards.
BAELISH,If she's escaped the capital Winterfell seems the logical destination.
CERSEI,And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.
BAELISH,Curious.
CERSEI,If we choose to negotiate with the Starks the girl has some value. Whoever finds her well
BAELISH,Well you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it
CERSEI,A mockingbird. . You created your own Sigil didn't you?
BAELISH,Yes.
CERSEI,Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.
BAELISH,I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way.
CERSEI,I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly she had eyes for another.
BAELISH,When boys and girls live in the same home awkward situations can arise. Sometimes I've heard
CERSEI,And which truth is that?
BAELISH,Knowledge is power.
CERSEI,Seize him.  Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it.Cersei walks away from Baelish her guards following close behind. The servant boy scrubbing the floor looks up at Baelish.CUT TO: NORTHINT. ROBBS TENT

And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned. Their families can honor them with proper funerals.
ALTON,An honorable request Your Grace.
ROBB,Third... Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time till the end of time we are a free and independent kingdom.Alton looks at him wide-eyed.
SER RODRIK,The King in the North.
THE OTHERS AT THE TABLE,King in the North.
ROBB,Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command he shall suffer the same fate as my father only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me.
ALTON,These are... Your Grace these are...
ROBB,These are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them I'll give them peace. If not I will litter the south with Lannister dead.
ALTON,King Joffrey is a Baratheon Your Grace.
ROBB,Oh is he? You'll ride at daybreak Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight.After everyone else leaves the tent
THEON,A word Your Grace?
ROBB,You don't have to call me <91>Your Grace when no one's around.
THEON,It's not so bad once you get used to it.
ROBB,I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.
THEON,The Lannisters are going to reject your terms you know?
ROBB,Of course they are.
THEON,We can fight them in the fields as long as you like but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them.
ROBB,Men who fought my father.
THEON,Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together.INT. A DIFFERENT TENT - LATER
CATELYN,You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
ROBB,I need his ships. They say he has 200.
CATELYN,They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us?Catelyn is preparing to go somewhere gathering up various items.
ROBB,I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.
CATELYN,I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.
ROBB,Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another.
CATELYN,I mothered more than just rebels a fact you seem to have forgotten.
ROBB,If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls my bannermen will string me up by my feet.
CATELYN,You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands? And Arya I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for if not for them?
ROBB,It's more complicated than that! You know it is.A long pause follows. Catelyn sits down.
CATELYN,It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.
ROBB,You can't go to Winterfell.
CATELYN,I beg your pardon?
ROBB,I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys <91>cause tomorrow you'll ride south to the Stormlands.
CATELYN,Why in the name of all the Gods -
ROBB,Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100 000. You know him. You know his family.
CATELYN,I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords -
ROBB,Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good.

CERSEI,What is all this?
JOFFREY,Returning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it not vines and flowers.
CERSEI,We can't find Arya Stark.
JOFFREY,With luck she's dead in a ditch somewhere.
CERSEI,Perhaps. But if not we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone.
JOFFREY,I think they might. They're weak. They put too much value on their women. .
CERSEI,We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -
JOFFREY,The King does not ask; He commands. And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.
CERSEI,His life is in danger.
JOFFREY,We're at war. All our lives are in danger. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime. And you.
CERSEI,Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.
JOFFREY,It's not a claim. The throne is mine.
CERSEI,Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -
JOFFREY,Someone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?
CERSEI,What are you asking?
JOFFREY,I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running -Cersei instinctively slaps Joffrey. It grows quiet as many workers look over at Joffrey and Cersei. Joffre looks up shocked and then around to the workers in the room. Cersei appears nervous.

CERSEI,He did what needed to be done. . You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds
TYRION,I'm no king
CERSEI,I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't
TYRION,. As has Jaime repeatedly
CERSEI,You're funny. . You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one
TYRION,She was my mother too.
CERSEI,Now they're gone
DAVOS,Your Grace.
MATTHOS,Your Grace.
STANNIS,How did it fare with your pirate?
DAVOS,Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.
STANNIS,In my experience
DAVOS,Does seem the wiser choice.
STANNIS,It won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?
DAVOS,Salladhor Saan is an old friend
STANNIS,Well if he does his job
DAVOS,At once
MELISANDRE,The Lord of Light shines through you
DAVOS,Come.STANNIS: What did you say to him?
MELISANDRE,I told him death by fire is the purest death.
STANNIS,Why?
MELISANDRE,Because it is true. You're troubled my king.
STANNIS,Yeah.
MELISANDRE,These armies are but toys for the Lord of Light.
STANNIS,Tell your lord to burn them then.
MELISANDRE,I tell him nothing! I pray for his commands and I obey.
STANNIS,My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts. Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
MELISANDRE,You must have faith.
STANNIS,Faith? In a real war
MELISANDRE,Then we must be the ten.
STANNIS,I cannot defeat my brother in the field
MELISANDRE,I have seen the path to victory in the flames. At first
STANNIS,I've said the words
MELISANDRE,You must give... all of yourself.Melisandre disrobes next to Stannis. He looks over and then looks away.
STANNIS,I have a wife. I took a vow.
MELISANDRE,She's sick. Weak. Shut away in the tower. And she disgusts you. And she's given you nothing. No sons. Only stillborns. Only death. . I will give you a son
STANNIS,. A son?They begin kissing. Melisandre takes off what remained of her clothes. Stannis lays her on the table and they begin having sex
CRASTER,Out. All of you.
JEOR,Wait outside.
JON,Lord Commander --
JEOR,Now!Jon snow leaves.OUTSIDE
SAM,Lord Commander.
JEOR,Leave us.  What did you do?
JON,Followed him. He took the baby into the woods - the newborn.
JEOR,And what business is that of yours?
JON,You don't understand. He's killing them all the boys -- you know.
JEOR,The wildlings serve crueler gods than you and I. Those boys are his offerings.
JON,Offerings? He's murdering his own children! He's a monster!
JEOR,Many times that monster's been the difference between life and death of our rangers. Your uncle among them. We have other wars to fight out there! Like it or not we need men like Craster.
JON,I saw it. I saw... something take that child.
JEOR,Whatever it was. I dare say you'll see it again. Now ready my horse. We leave at dawn.  Don't lose it again.In the morningGilly exits the Keep. Sam follows her.
SAM,Gilly.
GILLY,You're leaving.
SAM,I wanted to give you something. Belonged to my mother.
GILLY,I can't take it.
SAM,Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She let me sit with her in a chamber while she sewed and read to her. Father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the wall.
GILLY,You... you shouldn't give it away.
SAM,I'm not giving it away - I'm giving it to you. Keep it safe for me till I come back.Gilly takes it and rushes off. Sam smiles and leaves.WINTERFELL
MAN 1,Here we are.
MAN 2,The Rains of Castamere!
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE,You fucking dick! Same wrong guess every fucking time. Listen ya cunt.
MAN 3,Oh The Bear and the Maiden Fair!
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE,There's a man with an ear. Too bad you've got a hangnail for a cock. First time I saw you with your britches down I thought you were a eunuch! You seen it girls. Like a baby snail peekin' out of his shell. *laughs and walks toward Gilly* *to Gilly* Your baby was crying this morning. It waked me up. You hear me?
GILLY,Yes.
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE,Well what are you going to say?
GILLY,I'm sorry it woke you up.
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE,I don't care if you're sorry. Keep that baby quiet or I will.
GILLY,Don't you ever touch him.
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE,Hehehe little Wildling bitch. You should've stayed with your own kind. *an owl hoots in the distance* Are you listening to me?
GILLY,Shut your mouth.
MOLE'S TOWN WHORE,What? It's just an owl you dumb bitch.
GILLY,No it's not.
CUT TO,CASTLE BLACK
SAM,I should never have left her there.
JON,You couldn't have known.
SAM,Of course I could've known. They were raiding the villages close by.
GRENN,And we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers?
ED,Our brothers had orders to stay at Castle Black.
GRENN,Oh so it's alright then?! Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?!
ED,I didn't say it was alright! I'm sayin' they shouldn't have been there.
GRENN,We pledged to guard the realms of men.
SAM,She's dead because of me.
GRENN,We can't even guard Mole's Town.
JON,We can't go after them you know that. That's what they want.
SAM,Little Same. As if I'd cut their throats myself.
PYP,Maybe she managed to hide herself. I thought one of you was dead you went North with Mormont and no one came back. Not for ages. But then you did.
ED,She survived Craster and he was the worst shit I've ever met. She survived the long march to the wall. She survived a white walker for fuck's sake. She might've got out.
SAM,She might have.
JON,If they hit Mole's Town then we're next. Mance's army must be close.
ED,A hundred thousand.
GRENN,And there's what 5 of us left.
ED,If you're counting Black Jack Kegs
PYP,How do a hundred and two men stop a thousand?
ED,Whoever dies last be a good lad and burn the rest of us. Once I'm done with this world
CUT TO,MEEREEN
DANY,You think he was spying on you?
MISSANDEI,No not spying.
DANY,The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see.
MISSANDEI,Yes your grace.
DANY,But you are not Dothraki.
MISSANDEI,No.
DANY,Well I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested
MISSANDEI,He was interested.
DANY,What?
MISSANDEI,I believe he was interested.
DANY,When the slavers castrate the boys do they take all of it?
MISSANDEI,All of it?
DANY,The...the pillar an the stones.
MISSANDEI,I don't know your grace.
DANY,Haven't you ever wondered?
MISSANDEI,Yes your grace.
GREY WORM,Missandei. *in Valyrian* I have come to apologize.
MISSANDEI,*in Valyrian* You don't need to apologize.
GREY WORM,*in Valyrian* I hope I didn't frighten you.
MISSANDEI,*in Valyrian* No.
GREY WORM,The lessons you give I in Common tongue these are precious to I.
MISSANDEI,To me.
GREY WORM,To me.
MISSANDEI,I don't remember teaching you the word precious.
GREY WORM,Jorah the Andal he teaches I...he teaches me this word.
MISSANDEI,Do you remember the name you were given at birth?
GREY WORM,I remember nothing. Only unsullied.
MISSANDEI,When they cut you do you remember that?
MISSANDEI,I'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you.
GREY WORM,Why? Why sorry?
MISSANDEI,It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.
GREY WORM,*approaches Missandei* If the masters never cut me I am never unsullied. I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the masters. I never am chosen to lead the unsullied. I never meet Missandei from the Island of Naath. I am sorry I...for today. I am sorry.
MISSANDEI,*in Valyrian* Grey Worm.
MISSANDEI,*in Valyrian* I'm glad you saw me.
GREY WORM,*in Valyrian* So am I.
CUT TO,MOAT CAILIN
RAMSAY,Bracken. Mmm strong. As long as they're in the see. But when you take them out of the water
THEON,I'm Theon Greyjoy son of Balon
RAMSAY,And what are you really?
THEON,I'm Reek.
RAMSAY,Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable proud.
THEON,I'm Reek.
RAMSAY,Until when?
THEON,Always. Forever.
RAMSAY,That's right. Until you're rotting in the ground. Remember what you are and what you're not. Bring me Lord Kenning.
GUARD 1,*to Theon* No closer. Who are you?
RALF,I'm Kenning commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?
THEON,Yes.
RALF,And why should I believe that?
THEON,I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.
EVERYONE,What is dead may never die.
RALF,And if you were my prince why are you marching with a Bolton army?
THEON,Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.
RALF,And what does Lord Bolton want?
THEON,You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.
RALF,He wants us to surrender?
THEON,My own father your king
RALF,...shame fought with honor.
THEON,I'm sorry I didn't hear...
RALF,No shame fought with honor. Only a whipped dog would speak this way. Or a woman. Are you a woman boy?
THEON,*scared* You don't know.
RALF,The Ironborn will not surrender.
THEON,*whispering* Reek. Reek.
RALF,You go tell your master that Theon Greyjoy. Or whoever the fuck you are. What in the hell are you muttering?
THEON,Reek.
MAN 4,If we yield we live? Is that what it says on this paper here?
THEON,Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.
RAMSAY,You didn't really think I'd let them go did you? It's falling out of fashion. Fileting. Sad but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history
THEON,Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?
RAMSAY,I believe we will. To our new home.
CUT TO,THE VALE
PETYR,A great-grandfather from Braavos yes. I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally.
LORD ROYCE,Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago. We've fought off invaders ever since.
PETYR,The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families. Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock Lord Royce.
LORD ROYCE,She told me nothing about you Baelish. But I didn't need to hear from her. Moneylender. Whoremonger. You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long
PETYR,My lord...
LORD ROYCE,And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here
PETYR,Lady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood.
LADY ANYA,Yes we all know how close you were. Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair. Her death is our affair.
PETYR,Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.
LADY ANYA,She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.
LORD ROYCE,Strange that within days of your arrival you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door.
PETYR,She was always prone to melancholy. My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.
LORD ROYCE,We were told there was a witness. A girl.
LADY ANYA,A niece of yours I believe.
PETYR,A girl with no learning and scattered wits. I assure you she would be of no help.
LORD ROYCE,We'd like to speak with her.
PETYR,Let me fetch her.
LADY ANYA,No need. We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.
LADY ANYA,Come closer child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room.
PETYR,My lady...
LADY ANYA,I wasn't asking you.
SANSA,He can stay.
LORD ROYCE,Speak up girl
SANSA,*to Petyr* I'm sorry Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything.
LADY ANYA,Please Alayne
SANSA,My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce
LORD ROYCE,Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face you little worm?
SANSA,Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me
SER VANCE,Your secret is safe with us my lady.
LORD ROYCE,Your father grew up right here in these halls. We hunted together many times. He was a fine man.
LADY ANYA,Tell us what happened to your aunt Sansa.
SANSA,You knew her well my lords
LORD ROYCE,Lady Sansa.
SANSA,It was a peck on the cheek Lord Royce
LADY ANYA,Shh. Shh it's not your fault
LORD ROYCE,You could see it in the way she raised that boy. Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.
LADY ANYA,Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.
LORD ROYCE,Apologies my lady. And to you as well
PETYR,You want justice Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that. I want the same.
LADY ANYA,Not much justice to be meted out in suicide is there?
PETYR,For Lysa no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago
LORD ROYCE,Are you questioning our courage?
PETYR,I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?
LORD ROYCE,Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.
PETYR,No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now?
LADY ANYA,Who would you have us back Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead.
PETYR,I'd have you back Robin Arryn Lord of the Vale.
LADY ANYA,Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.
PETYR,And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.
LADY ANYA,More often they die young.
PETYR,I adored Lysa with all my heart. But she loved her son so much she became overprotective. He needs to learn how to swing a sword. How to ride a horse.
LORD ROYCE,Aye it's time.
PETYR,Yes it's time. Time for him to tour the Vale
CUT TO,MEEREEN
BOY,Ser Barristan.
SER BARRISTAN,Yes? Who sent you?
SER JORAH,Ser Barristan.
SER BARRISTAN,Ser Jorah.
SER JORAH,Have I forgotten a council meeting?
SER BARRISTAN,No.
SER JORAH,What's this?
SER BARRISTAN,A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon. You spied on her.
SER JORAH,Who gave you this?
SER BARRISTAN,Does it matter?
SER JORAH,Have you told her?
SER BARRISTAN,I wanted to tell you first man-to-man rather than go behind your back.
SER JORAH,Let me speak with her in private.
SER BARRISTAN,You'll never be alone with her again.
DANY,Why did the usurper pardon you?
SER JORAH,If we could speak alone.
DANY,No speak to me here. Explain it to me.
SER JORAH,Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister. He wants to divide us. If we're fighting each other we're not fighting him.
DANY,The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.
SER JORAH,It is not forged.
DANY,Why then?
SER JORAH,I sent letters to Varys the spymaster of King's Landing.
DANY,What was the content of these letters?
SER JORAH,Information.
DANY,What information?
SER JORAH,When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos. His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo. When you were married. When your brother died.
DANY,You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?
SER JORAH,I...
DANY,Yes or no?
SER JORAH,Khaleesi.
DANY,Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?
SER JORAH,Yes.
DANY,That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.
SER JORAH,I stopped you from drinking his wine.
DANY,Because you knew it was poisoned.
SER JORAH,I suspected.
DANY,You betrayed me from the first.
SER JORAH,Forgive me. I never meant...please Khaleesi
DANY,You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...
SER JORAH,I have protected you. Fought for you. Killed for you.
DANY,...and you want me to forgive you?
SER JORAH,I have loved you.
DANY,Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man and I would have you executed. But you
SER JORAH,Daenerys please.
DANY,Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now.
CUT TO,MOAT CAILIN
RAMSAY,Moat Cailin is yours Father.
LORD BOLTON,Walk with me. Has there been any word from Locke?
RAMSAY,No.
RAMSAY,Unimportant. A cripple a young boy. None of the northern lords have seen them. Dead most likely. Most of the Ironborn have fled the North. Now more will follow
RAMSAY,Moors fields
RAMSAY,Tell me what you see.
RAMSAY,Nothing.
ROOSE,Not nothing. The North. Ride 700 miles that way you're still in the North. 400 miles that way. 300 miles that way. The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined. And I am the Warden of the North. The North is mine. Now tell me
RAMSAY,Ramsay Snow.
ROOSE,No not Ramsay Snow. *hands Ramsay a scroll* Open it. From this day until your last day
RAMSAY,You honor me. I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition. I will be worthy of you Father
RAMSAY,Come Reek
CUT TO,THE VALE
SANSA,Yes?
PETYR,First time I saw you you were just a child. A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. Not a child any longer. Why did you help me?
SANSA,They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.
PETYR,That's not an answer.
SANSA,If they'd have executed you what would they have done with me?
PETYR,I don't know.
SANSA,Neither do I.
PETYR,Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't? And you think you know me?
SANSA,I know what you want.
PETYR,Do you?
CUT TO,OUTSIDE THE VALE
HOUND,I thought it'd make me happy but it doesn't. Not really. Nothing makes you happy.
ARYA,Lots of things make me happy.
HOUND,Like what?
ARYA,Killing Polliver killing Rorge.
HOUND,So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself. Is that it?
ARYA,At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.
HOUND,Aye nothing in the world beats that look.
ARYA,You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?
HOUND,I wasn't the damn wine taster. Little shit deserved to die but poison...poison's a woman's weapon. Men kill with steel.
ARYA,That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.
HOUND,*laughs* I'd pay good money to see that. *grunts and rubs his neck*
ARYA,You should have let me burn it.
HOUND,It's a fleabite.
ARYA,That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.
HOUND,Well we won't have to walk too much further.
ARYA,You really think my aunt will pay for me?
HOUND,Aye she'll pay.
ARYA,I've never even met her.
HOUND,Doesn't matter. You're her blood. Family honor
ARYA,I'm not a lady.
GUARD,Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
HOUND,The bloody Hound Sandor Clegane. And his...traveling companion Arya Stark
GUARD,Then I offer my condolences. Lady Arryn died. Three days ago.[Arya bursts out laughing]
CUT TO,THE VALE
ROBIN,I've never left home before Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave.
PETYR,You shouldn't be.
ROBIN,The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie Mother said. She said it's not safe outside.
PETYR,It wasn't safe for her inside. People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots. Everybody dies sooner or later. Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life. Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.
SANSA,Shall we go?
CUT TO,KING'S LANDING
TYRION,Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?
JAIME,Soon.
TYRION,Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly right?
JAIME,I've never seen him fight.
TYRION,Oh he's going to die. I'm going to die.
JAIME,Oberyn believes in himself.
TYRION,That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?
JAIME,Beheading.
TYRION,Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide
JAIME,Cousins.
TYRION,Cousins you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?
JAIME,Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.
TYRION,Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.
TOGETHER,Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!
TYRION,Nothing made him happier.
JAIME,Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
TYRION,On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
JAIME,The joke wore thin though.
TYRION,For you. You drifted away.
JAIME,I had other interests.
TYRION,Yes other interests. But I stayed with Orson.
JAIME,Why?
TYRION,"I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library."
JAIME,Volarik. Tried to touch me once.
JAIME,Every day around the world men
TYRION,I know I know. But still
JAIME,He was twice your size.
TYRION,"He just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?"
JAIME,I don't know.
JAIME,Good luck today.
TYRION,Looks like very light armor.
OBERYN,I like to move around.
TYRION,You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.
OBERYN,You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.
TYRION,It could get you killed. It could get me killed.
OBERYN,Today is not the day I die.
ELLARIA,You're going to fight that?
OBERYN,I'm going to kill that.
ELLARIA,He is the biggest man I've ever seen.
OBERYN,Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.TYRION: Thank the gods.
PYCELL,In the sight of gods and men we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this...man Tyrion Lannister. May the Mother grant them mercy. May the Father give them such justice as they deserve. And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion...
ELLARIA,Don't leave me alone in this world.
OBERYN,Never.
OBERYN,Have they told you who I am?
MOUNTAIN,Some dead man.
OBERYN,I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.
OBERYN,I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick.
OBERYN,Say it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children.
OBERYN,You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!
OBERYN,You raped her! You murdered her!
OBERYN,You killed her children!
OBERYN,Wait. Are you dying? No no
MOUNTAIN,Elia Martell. I killed her children. Then I raped her. Then I smashed her head in like this!
TYWEN,*standing up* The gods have made their will known. Tyrion Lannister in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon
JON,She...she had red hair.SAM: Oh? How big were her feet?
JON,Well what do you want me to say?
SAM,I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.
JON,So you and Gilly never-
SAM,No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.
JON,But if she had
SAM,The interesting thing is
JON,"What?SAM: ""I shall take no wife"" yes"
JON,I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.
SAM,Anyway
JON,It's...there's this person
SAM,No
JON,And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.
SAM,There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.
JON,There will.
SAM,They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.
JON,Go get some sleep
TORMUND,Did I ever tell you about her? My Sheila?
YGRITTE,Yes.
TORMUND,Oh that was a night to remember. Of course
YGRITTE,I know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't wanna think about the bear you never fucked. Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crow's heart.
TORMUND,We could be waiting here a while.
YGRITTE,Good. The longer we wait
STYR,You've got a lot to say about killing. Even more words than arrows.
YGRITTE,Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did. More
STYR,Yes. But none of those were your Crow lover.
YGRITTE,I probably killed him already.
STYR,So you've said.
YGRITTE,And if not. The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck.
STYR,And more words. Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.
YGRITTE,What
STYR,Maybe I have.
YGRITTE,Jon Snow is mine. *shouting* Anyone else tries to kill him
AEMON,And what is it that couldn't wait until morning
SAM,Maester Aemon. How did you know-
AEMON,That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?
SAM,Let me help you.
AEMON,Oh
SAM,Maester Faull
AEMON,Ah
SAM,But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.
AEMON,Yes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. That's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love.
SAM,I don't love her.
AEMON,Yes you do.
SAM,No.
AEMON,Yes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me. I remember how it sounds! I was in love once.
SAM,You were?
AEMON,You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child
SAM,I'm sorry Maester
AEMON,You know who I was before I came here? What I could've been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.
SAM,Who was she?
AEMON,Ah ha. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was. How we met. The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.
PYP,I'm sorry
GILLY,They killed everyone! Everyone but me and my baby. And they're out there. I saw them on the way here
PYP,I'm sorry
GILLY,If they find the boy
SAM,Pyp! Open the gate.
PYP,I can't.
GILLY,Sam
SAM,Yes!
PYP,Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.
SAM,Oh
PYP,I've never heard you curse before.
SAM,Yes
SAM,Are you alright? Shh
GILLY,It was horrible.
SAM,I'm so so sorry. I didn't know until I got back.
GILLY,Don't let them send me away
SAM,Never.
GILLY,I know there's no women allowed.
SAM,Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me. From now on
ALLISER,Get ready!
THENN WARG,It's time.
JANOS,Pick up the pace!
JON,There we go
ALLISER,A hundred thousand you say?
JON,Yes sir.
ALLISER,You can say it if you like. We should've sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested.
JON,It was a difficult decision either way
ALLISER,Do you know what leadership means
SAM,You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.
GILLY,You're leaving me again?
SAM,I'm not leaving you!
GILLY,You're going up there and we're staying down here. That's leaving. You said from now on we'd stay together.
SAM,I...I didn't mean in the same room.
GILLY,What are you going to do out there?
SAM,Help my brothers.
GILLY,How?! You going to fight the Free Folk when they come? They'll kill you. In Molestown they killed everyone.
SAM,I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.
GILLY,Why not? You won't matter up there
SAM,Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch
GILLY,Promise me you won't die.
SAM,I promise you I won't die.
SAM,There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.
PYP,I've never thrown a spear before. I've never held a sword with a proper edge. There's no place for me to be. You're not afraid?
SAM,Of course I'm afraid
PYP,Well if you're afraid of a band of Wildlings
SAM,I didn't know I was going to kill it
PYP,But you're afraid now?
SAM,Yes
YGRITTE,Most of their men are up top. Didn't count more than twenty down there. Leftovers. They've got a little fat one and a little bony one manning the front.
STYR,How high are the walls?
YGRITTE,Well
TORMUND,Let's kill some Crows!
TORMUND,*yells* Come on! *puts out the fire*
ALLISER,Archers knock
ALLISER,I said knock and hold you cunts! Does knock mean draw?!
NIGHT'S WATCH,No Ser!
ALLISER,Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?!
NIGHT'S WATCH,No Ser!
ALLISER,You all plan to die here tonight?
NIGHT'S WATCH,No Ser!
ALLISER,That's very good to hear. Draw!
MEMBER 1,Help
JANOS,They're attacking the southern gates!
ALLISER,Now?
JANOS,Now!
ALLISER,I'm going down then. Brother Slynt
JANOS,What?!
ALLISER,What are you fucking waiting for
JANOS,You heard the man. Loose!
TORMUND,You
SAM,Did you get one?
PYP,No. Ah shit
SAM,Yeah?
PYP,I think we're gonna die.
SAM,If you keep missing we will.
ALLISER,Brothers! A hundred generations have defended this castle. We've never fallen before. She will not fall tongiht. Those are Things at our walls. They eat the flesh of the men they kill. Do you want to fill the belly of a Thing tonight?
NIGHT'S WATCH,No!
ALLISER,Tonight we fight. And when the sun rises I promise you
ALLISER,The Night's Watch will stand.
ALLISER,With me now! Now
JANOS,No discipline. No training. Gang of thieves
JANOS,The bars of those gates are four inches of cold
JON,Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold
JANOS,No such thing as giants. They're stories for the children.
GRENN,Brother Slynt! I've just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below. You're the most experienced man he's got
JANOS,Needed below? Yes. Yes.
JON,Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!
JON,They won't summit before dawn.
GRENN,How do you know that?
JON,Because I've made that claim.
ED,I think they're in a bigger hurry than you were.
JON,Knock! Draw! Loose!
PYP,I got one. Right through the heart
SAM,Oh
PYP,Huh?
SAM,Well then. *hands Pyp a loaded crossbow*
SAM,You're alright. You're alright. I'll get help. Shh
JON,Now!
ED,Now!
JON,*to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men
GRENN,Alright.
JON,*grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through...
GRENN,They won't. Come on Hill! And you Cooper! You three
JON,Oil!
ED,Oil on the ramp!
ALLISER,Protect the gate!
ALLISER,Hold the fucking gate! Hold it!
SAM,*to Grenn* We need more men down here.
GRENN,We have to hold the gate.
SAM,But we need men here.
GRENN,Tell Jon! He's in command. *to the men behind him* Let's go!
SAM,*to Olly* Get me to the top! You hear me?!
SAM,Your name's Olly
SAM,And find a weapon
JON,What are you doing up here?
SAM,The Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.
JON,Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again
JON,Two brothers now fight with me.
ED,Might as well enjoy our last night
DONNEL,How are we gonna stop that?
COOPER,We shot twenty-eight arrows in him already.
GRENN,You heard Jon
DONNEL,Jon Snow's not Lord Commander.
GRENN,We hold the gate!
DONNEL,Mother save me. Father save me.GRENN: The gods aren't down here. It's the six of us
DONNEL,No
GRENN,Night gathers
All TOGETHER,And win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch
JON,*to Sam* I don't want you out there.
SAM,You can't protect me forever. There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.
JON,I need him more than I need you.
SAM,We need you boy.
YGRITTE,Jon Snow.
JON,No
YGRITTE,We should've stayed in that cave.
JON,We'll go back there.YGRITTE: You know nothing
ED,Drop the scythe
ED,Hoister up!
ED,They've had enough for one night.
ED,Don't cheer too loud. They still outnumber us a thousand to one.
JON,Tormund. It's over
TORMuND,This is how a man ends.
JON,Put him in chains. We'll question him later.
TORMUND,I should've thrown you from the top of your wall boy!
JON,Aye
SAM,Woah! It's me. It's me. I promised you
SAM,We held them off.
JON,For one night.
SAM,This is a great victory.
JON,Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants
SAM,Where are you going?
JON,I'm going to find Mance.
SAM,To...you can't do that. No one gave you any orders.
JON,Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose
SAM,Without Mance? You're going to kill him?
JON,I'm going to try.
SAM,They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did
JON,He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.
SAM,He won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!
JON,You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?
JON,They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate
SAM,What are you doing?
JON,I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.
SAM,Jon. Come back.
MANCE,It appears my trusting nature got the better of me. It's happened before. I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us
JON,The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal
MANCE,Did you see her again at Castle Black?
JON,Yes.
MANCE,And?JON: She's dead.
MANCE,Your doing?
JON,No.
MANCE,We'll drink to her.
MANCE,Of all the ways I'd kill you
MANCE,Ygritte.
JON,Ygritte.
JON,That's not wine.
MANCE,No
JON,He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.MANCE: He was their king. Last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.
JON,Grenn came from a farm.
MANCE,Mag and Grenn.
JON,Grenn and Mag.
MANCE,Kullback
JON,Turn your army around and go home.
MANCE,You know I know you're low on arrows. You're low on oil. You're low on men. How many are left? 50?
JON,I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.
MANCE,I showed you everything I had. The whole army
MANCE,Ah! Oh
MANCE,You attacking us?
JON,No
MANCE,Hold! To me. To me.
MANCE,Stand down! I said my people have bled enough and I meant it.[Stannis Baratheon and Davos Seaworth ride up toward Mance Rayder. They get off their horses. Mance disarms himself]
STANNIS,You're the king beyond the wall?
STANNIS,You know who I am?
MANCE,Never had the pleasure.
DAVOS,This is Stannis Baratheon
MANCE,We're not in the seven kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.
STANNIS,It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.MANCE: We do not kneel.
STANNIS,I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall
MANCE,All the same
STANNIS,Take these men away.
DAVOS,What are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?
JON,I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.
DAVOS,You're speaking to the one true king boy. You'll address him as your grace.JON: I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow
STANNIS,Your father was an honorable man.
JON,He was
STANNIS,What do you think he'd have done with him?
JON,I was this man's prisoner once. He could've tortured me
STANNIS,Very well. *to Davos* Take him.JON: Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen
CUT TO,KING'S LANDING
PYCELLE,I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate.
CERSEI,Bloody Martells.PYCELLE: The cause appears to be manticore venom.
QYBURN,It is
PYCELLE,I've read a good deal about it. It's a horrible poison
PYCELLE,May I ask what you think you're doing?
QYBURN,Saving him.
PYCELLE,Your grace. I wish it were otherwise
QYBURN,That's for the best. No Maester knows how to save him.
PYCELLE,That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel
CERSEI,You're dismissed
PYCELLE,Your grace. This is my laboratory!
CERSEI,Not anymore.
CERSEI,You can save him?
QYBURN,Difficult to say
CERSEI,Do everything you can. Come to me with anything you need.
QYBURN,Thank you
CERSEI,Will it weaken him?
QYBURN,Oh no.
CERSEI,Very well then.
TYWIN,Not another word. We've been over this
CERSEI,I'm opening it again.
TYWIN,You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell. Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.
CERSEI,I will not.
TYWIN,Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have
CERSEI,I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son
TYWIN,When you were nine years old
CERSEI,I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.
TYWIN,Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?CERSEI: When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater
TYWIN,No.
CERSEI,Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy
TYWIN,And how will you do that?
CERSEI,I'll tell everyone the truth.
TYWIN,And what truth would that be?
CERSEI,You don't know
TYWIN,Known what?CERSEI: Everything they say is true about Jaime and me.
TYWIN,No
CERSEI,Your legacy is a lie.
TYWIN,I don't believe you.
CERSEI,Yes you do.
CERSEI,Jaime.JAIME: You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do
CERSEI,For my family
JAIME,Tyrion is your family.
CERSEI,He's not.
JAIME,You don't get to choose.
CERSEI,I do
JAIME,Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.
CERSEI,A disease doesn't decide to kill you
JAIME,The things I did to get back to you
CERSEI,I choose you.
JAIME,Those are words.
CERSEI,Yes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him.
JAIME,Told him what?
CERSEI,I told him about us.
JAIME,You told him?
CERSEI,I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen
JAIME,You think he'll just accept that?
CERSEI,Go and ask him.
JAIME,What did you say?
CERSEI,I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister
JAIME,Someone will walk in.
CERSEI,I don't care.

FENNESZ,Before you freed me
DAENERYS,I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you?
FENNESZ,When you took the city

FENNESZ,I do not mean to offend
DAENERYS,My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend

FENNESZ,Your grace
DAENERYS,You want to return to a man who owned you
FENNESZ,Please
DAENERYS,I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.
FENNESZ,Thank you
BARRISTAN,The masters will take advantage of this situation. The men serving them will be slaves in all but name.

TORMUND,You want me alive so you can torture me?
JON,No one's going to torture you.
TORMUND,So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading? Drop us from the top of the wall?
JON,I don't know what happens to the prisoners.
TORMUND,Who decides?
JON,I suppose Stannis does.
TORMUND,He your king now?
JON,I don't have a king.
TORMUND,You spent too much time with us
JON,We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them?

TORMUND,Do what?
JON,Say farewell.
TORMUND,The dead can't hear us

JAIME,This is exactly what they want.
CERSEI,...and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free?No response from Jaime.

DAARIO,Because I questioned him.

MOSSADOR,He is born free.
HIZDAHR,Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?
DAENERYS,Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.

VARYS,Yes
VARYS,Why?
TYRION,'Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant.
VARYS,People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.
TYRION,I find us repulsive.
VARYS,And we find them repulsive
TYRION,You're right. Let's go for a walk.
VARYS,No.
TYRION,How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?INT. KING'S LANDING - QYBURN'S ROOMA dwarf head is placed on her desk.
CERSEI,Not him.
MERYN,Are you trying to deceive your Queen? Shall I throw them in a cell
CERSEI,That won't be necessary
HUNTERS,Thank you
CERSEI,Take the head.
QYBURN,Pardon me
CERSEI,Very good.She and Qyburn exit the room.
QYBURN,Over there will be fine.
MERYN,You heard the man. Over there.The hunters pick up the dwarf head.INT. KING'S LANDING - RED KEEPCersei and Qyburn enter the room
KEVAN,You're the Hand of the King?
CERSEI,No
MACE TYRELL,Your Grace
CERSEI,You're a good man
MACE,Oh
CERSEI,He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.
MACE,The honor is all mine
PYCELLE,Your Grace
CERSEI,The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.
PYCELLE,Your Grace
CERSEI,The qualification of loyalty
PYCELLE,I must say I cannot see--
CERSEI,Uncle Kevan
KEVAN,That is kind of you to say. I would like to hear it from the king himself.
CERSEI,The king is very busy at this moment.
KEVAN,He should be here
CERSEI,He is learning. On this occasion
KEVAN,I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother. And to you. And to serve the king. I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet. To watch you stack the small council with sycophants.  Sending your own brother away so he wouldn't be--
CERSEI,My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.
KEVAN,What mission?
CERSEI,That is not your concern as Master of War.
KEVAN,I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern. You are the Queen Mother. Nothing more.Kevan gets up from his seat.
CERSEI,You would abandon your king in his time of need?
KEVAN,If he wants to send for me
SHIREEN,Come on. You know this one. It looks like an animal.
GILLY,Snake. Snake... S! It's an S!
SHIREEN,Right
SAM,Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history
GILLY,"I know ""S""."
SHIREEN,You'll learn
GILLY,Well
SAM,I only said that the more time you spend practicing
GILLY,That's alright. We're doing just fine. I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about.Sam goes back to his book.
GILLY,How old were you when you learned to read?
SHIREEN,Three.
SAM,Three?! Who taught you
SHIREEN,No. Old Maester Cressen did. I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because...
GILLY,What do you call it in the South
SHIREEN,Greyscale. What do you call it north of the Wall?
GILLY,I don't know. But two of my sisters had it. They both died. How did they cure you?
SHIREEN,I don't remember. I was a baby. Lots of people came and tried
GILLY,My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside. None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them. Especially at night. They started to sound... not like themselves.
SAM,Did you ever see them?
GILLY,Only once at the end. They were covered with it. Their faces
SHIREEN,What did he do to them in the woods?Gilly is afraid to answer. Selyse enters the room before she can.
SHIREEN,Mother.
SELYSE,Leave us.
SAM,Your Grace.Sam and Gilly exit the room.
SELYSE,You need to stay away from that girl.
SHIREEN,Why?
SELYSE,She's a wildling.
SHIREEN,Her name's Gilly. She's nice. I'm teaching her to read.
SELYSE,She's a wildling. Your father defeated their people. He executed her king for treason. They could strike at him by striking at you.
SHIREEN,Gilly wouldn't do that.
SELYSE,You have no idea what people will do. All your books and you still don't know.Selyse exits the library.INT. CASTLE BLACK - STANNIS'S ROOM
STANNIS,I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness
JON,With respect
STANNIS,Who then? You?
JON,No. Only one of their own.
STANNIS,Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?
JON,The Lord Commander's niece.
STANNIS,Lady of Bear Island
JON,"""Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North"
STANNIS,That amuses you?
JON,I apologize
STANNIS,I know. My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them - even with your father's help.
DAVOS,Tonight
JON,Most likely.
DAVOS,Unpleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?
JON,Unpleasant
STANNIS,Your bravery made him look weak. He'll punish you for it. I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them.
JON,I don't doubt it
STANNIS,You can give me the North.
JON,I can't. Even if I wanted to
STANNIS,Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet. Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark
SAM,He'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?
JON,It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king
SAM,You deserve this. You do. I couldn't be happier for you.
JON,I'm going to refuse him.
SAM,But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.
JON,I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously
ALLISER,Crowded. You'd think we were serving venison stew.Maester Aemon rises slowly from the table at the front.
AEMON,Does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?Janos Slynt stands up.
JANOS,Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight
MEN,Hear
JANOS,He's a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life. He's the only true choice.Alliser smiles. Men cheer and beat on the tables.
AEMON,Is there anyone else?
SHADOW TOWER BROTHER,Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger. Through 10 winters he served. As commander of the Shadow Tower
AEMON,If there's no one else
SAM,Maester Aemon.Every Brother
AEMON,"Samwell Tarly. Go on.Jon shakes his head ""no"" at Sam."
JANOS,Sam the Slayer.The whole room laughs.
JANOS,Another wildling lover just like his friend Jon Snow. How's your lady love Slayer?More laughs.
SAM,Her name is Gilly. Brother Slynt knows her quite well. They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.The men start laughing at Janos now.
JANOS,Lies!
SAM,A wildling girl
SAM,Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children
SAM,Ser Alliser fought bravely
ALLISER,I can't argue with any of that.  But who does Jon Snow want to command? Night's Watch or the wildlings? Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with Mance Rayder many times. What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stannis's army hadn't come along? We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery. Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life
AEMON,It is time.Brothers of the Night's Watch walk to the front of the room
BROTHER,It appears to be a tie
BROTHERS,Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow!Jon rises

ARYA,Who are you? Why were they scared of you?
OLD MAN,You lost this.He tosses Arya her coin
ARYA,You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.
JAQEN,There isn't. A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.He begins to head back inside the House of Black and White.
ARYA,Well who are you then?He turns back around.
JAQEN,No one. And that is who a girl must become.Jaqen opens the door and waits for Arya. After a moment

DAENERYS,Why?
MOSSADOR,For you
DAENERYS,He was our prisoner
MOSSADOR,He would rather rip your city apart than see slaves lifted from the dirt.
DAENERYS,There are no more slaves. There are no more Masters.
MOSSADOR,Then who lives in the Pyramids? Who wears gold masks and murders your children?  When Grey Worm came to us

DAARIO,Which is what I keep telling her to do to you.The former slaves continues to yell to their Mhysa while the masters leer at her.
CROWD,Brother! Brother!
MOSSADOR,Mhysa
DAENERYS,A citizen of Meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him. The punishment is death.
CROWD,Mercy! Mercy!Mossador looks to Daenerys
MOSSADOR,Mhysa... The crowd begs and pleads for mercy. Daenerys stares out to the crowd
CROWD,Mhysa...The crowd goes silent. Suddenly
BARRISTAN,I'll stand guard outside your door tonight

DAENERYS,Drogon...He slowly climbs down to her balcony. Daenerys extends her hand. Drogon sniffs it hesitantly
MAN,Valar morghulis.
JAQEN,Valar dohaeris.The man drinks the liquid and watches as he approaches the statue of the woman with her eyes closed. He kneels down in front of it. Arya puts her broom down and approaches Jaqen.
ARYA,I've been sweeping this floor for days.
JAQEN,Good.
ARYA,I didn't come here to sweep floors.
JAQEN,No? Why come then?
ARYA,You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.
JAQEN,A man teaches a girl. .
ARYA,I want to serve. .
JAQEN,A girl wants to serve herself. Here we serve the Many-Faced God to serve well. A girl must become no-one.
ARYA,Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the Weirwood Face.
JAQEN,There is only one god. A girl knows his name. And all men know his gift.Jaqen leaves. Arya looks down at the man who had been kneeling. He is lying on his back dead. Two men come into the room with a stretcher. They places the mans body on it and begin walking to an open door at the end of the room. The waif walks past Arya.
ARYA,Where are they taking him?The waif doesnt respond but continues walking. Arya turns to watch as the door closes behind the men carrying the stretcher.CUT TO: KINGS LANDINGEXT.

MARGAERY,No. You were lovely.
TOMMEN,It all happened so fast.
MARGAERY,Yes. .
TOMMEN,I was scared maybe I hurt you it sounded
MARGAERY,No no no. You're very sweet. The sweetest king who ever lived.
TOMMEN,This is what I want to do all day every day for the rest of my life.
MARGAERY,Wouldn't that be glorious? . Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath there's no rush is there?
TOMMEN,Of course not. Are you hungry? Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?
MARGAERY,No I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name.TOMMEN: King Tommen. It still sounds strange to me. Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?
MARGAERY,So strange<85> Husband.
TOMMEN,Wife.  and it's all because my brother died.
MARGAERY,I understand. But it's not your fault you know that don't you? You mustn't feel guilty.
TOMMEN,I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.Margaery looks at him curiously. He suddenly sits up.
TOMMEN,Do you like to sail?
MARGAERY,. I love to sail.
TOMMEN,I do too.
MARGAERY,I think we're going to be very happy you and I.
TOMMEN,I do too.She kisses him and turns around. She gets up wrapping a bedsheet around herself as a cover.
MARGAERY,Living in a tower so high it touches the clouds. Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital is not for everyone I suppose. Does your mother like it here?
TOMMEN,I don't think so. She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.
MARGAERY,It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guiding her cub. .
TOMMEN,Well but I'm a man now.
MARGAERY,You are. And the king. . But you'll always be her baby-boy.
TOMMEN,I suppose.
MARGAERY,I adore how she has always been so generous with me so kind. And the horror she's had to injure. . Losing her husband her eldest child and her father. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight.EXT. CASTLE WALLCersei and Tommen walk together her arm around his. A group of guards walk behind them.
CERSEI,You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty isn't she? Like a doll she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters.
TOMMEN,Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?
CERSEI,There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.
TOMMEN,That's where you grew up. . You always told me that you liked the people there better. You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.
CERSEI,. Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?
TOMMEN,The way that you talked about it I always thought that you missed it. That you... That it was your real home.
CERSEI,This is my real home now. Where my family lives.
TOMMEN,I want you to be happy mother.
CERSEI,I know that. I know you do my sweet boy.
TOMMEN,But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?INT. ROOMCersei approaches a room with two guards. Inside Margaery is having tea with some of her friends.
MARGAERY,"I said ""Darling surely 4 times is enough are you trying to set a new record?"" . And he said ""Well what is the record? I'm sure we can break it.""Margaerys friends laugh. As Cersei walks in they all get up and bow."
MARGAERY,Mother! . Welcome.
CERSEI,Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.
MARGAERY,Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.
CERSEI,No no. I I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if there is ever anything I can do for you.
MARGAERY,You are very sweet.
CERSEI,Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.
MARGAERY,I absolutely adore him. You raised a gallant young man. I'm forever grateful.
CERSEI,Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.
MARGAERY,Ecstatic. I really am. Exhausted to be honest but what can I expect he is half lion half stag. .
CERSEI,I'll leave you to it then. .
MARGAERY,Oh forgive me I haven't been at Court for long I get so confused. What's the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?
CERSEI,There's no need for such formalities.
MARGAERY,In any event judging from the King's enthusiasm the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon.
CERSEI,Wont that be a lovely day.
MARGAERY,Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.

Cersei walks away with her two guards still able to hear the laughter.CUT TO: WINTERFELLEXT. COURTYARDA horse whinnies. Bolton bannermen ride to the keep. In the keep a number of workmen are busy building and repairing things. Some men carry some raven cages through the middle of the courtyard. Theon carrying a dead bird walks through for a moment. He then comes across some soldiers lifting up some flayed bodies with rope. He becomes very tense and forces himself to keep walking head down. A raven picks at a body in a cart.INT. DINING HALLRoose and Ramsay sit at a table as Theon cuts some food. Ramsay talks with his face stuffed.
ROOSE,We can't hold the North with terror alone.
RAMSAY,You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.
ROOSE,I sent you there to collect taxes not bodies.
RAMSAY,Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot.Theon holds the food in front of Ramsay. He takes some of it and puts it on his plate.
ROOSE,He left you no choice.
RAMSAY,I flayed him living along with his wife and brother. Made his son watch.
ROOSE,And?
RAMSAY,The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.
ROOSE,. I have something important to tell you. Stop eating and listen.Ramsay who had been heavily engrossed in his eating stops suddenly and looks up. Theon slowly puts down a plate nearby. Ramsay puts down his silverware and sits back looking at his father.
ROOSE,We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?
RAMSAY,Our pact with the Lannisters protects -
ROOSE,I had a pact with Tywin Lannister and Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us you're a fool. We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses and parleying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. . Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree it's time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North.CUT TO: MOAT CAILINEXT. NEARBY HILLSSansa Baelish and a number of knights ride towards Moat Cailin. The party stops. Baelish leads Sansa on foot to a spot where they can easily overlook the keep. The keep is shown surrounded by swampy riverlands.
SANSA,That's Moat Cailin.
BAELISH,Yes. A bit shabby isn't it? You've been here before.
SANSA,On our way down to King's Landing with my father and Arya and<85> where are you taking me?
BAELISH,Home.
SANSA,The Boltons have Winterfell. . The marriage proposal it wasn't for you?
BAELISH,. No.
SANSA,Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!
BAELISH,He did.
SANSA,He serves the Lannisters.
BAELISH,For now.
SANSA,I won't go.
BAELISH,Winterfell is your home.
SANSA,Not anymore.
BAELISH,Always. You're a Stark. Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark. The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North.
SANSA,I can't marry him. You can't make me. He's a traitor. A murderer.
BAELISH,You're not marrying Roose Bolton. No you'll be marrying his son and heir Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you will -
SANSA,No!
BAELISH,Sansa -
SANSA,No you can't make me. I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there.
BAELISH,. You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them.He kisses her forehead. He walks back to their horses. After a few moments she regains her composure and gets on her horse. The party starts moving again. On top of a large hill nearby Brienne and Podrick watch as the party arrives at the keep.
PODRICK,How do we get through there?
BRIENNE,We don't. We go around. .
PODRICK,It sets miles out of the way. We'll lose sight of them.
BRIENNE,Doesn't matter. I know where they're going.EXT. CAMPSITEPodrick sits scrubbing a boot.
BRIENNE,Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?
PODRICK,He hates that nickname.
BRIENNE,Well he's not here to complain about it is he?Podrick finishes scrubbing and hands the boot to Brienne. He puts the brush down. Brienne begins putting the boot on.
PODRICK,I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished so he borrowed a ham.
BRIENNE,He borrowed it?
PODRICK,He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning one of the guards saw him passed out under a wagon with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too but Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son.
BRIENNE,As punishment. For both of you.
PODRICK,It didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.
BRIENNE,. Yes all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person.
PODRICK,I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat The Hound. I'm proud to be your squire.
BRIENNE,I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.
PODRICK,If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.
BRIENNE,You want to be a knight Pod?
PODRICK,Yes.
BRIENNE,Starting tomorrow we'll train with the sword twice a day before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. . And I'm going to show you how to ride properly.
PODRICK,Thank you.
BRIENNE,I can't knight you but I can teach you how to fight.
PODRICK,I suppose that's more important.Podrick leans over the campfire with some rocks. He strikes them together until he gets a spark and blows until the fire starts going. He wipes himself off and stands up walking over to Brienne. He begins taking her armor off.
PODRICK,You weren't a knight but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon weren't you?
BRIENNE,I was.
PODRICK,Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.
BRIENNE,He was.
PODRICK,But how did you end up serving Renly?BRIENNE: . Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. <91>Brienne the Beauty they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. <93>Don't let them see your tears <94> he told me. <93>Theyre nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.<94> He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all.
PODRICK,But wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...
BRIENNE,Yes Pod he liked men I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me he didn't want me he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day I will avenge King Renly.
PODRICK,But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?
BRIENNE,A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man not a shadow. And a man can be killed.CUT TO: CASTLE BLACKINT. LORD COMMANDERS ROOMOlly opens the door for Stannis and Davos. Jon sits at his desk.
STANNIS,Lord Commander.
JON,. Your Grace.
STANNIS,. I'd like to speak alone.
JON,Olly is my steward now as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings to learn from men with experience. One day he might command.
STANNIS,Very well. . Have you considered my offer?
JON,I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
STANNIS,Say the word and you will be.
JON,But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.
STANNIS,I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.
JON,I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.STANNIS: You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.
JON,I can imagine no higher praise.
STANNIS,I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. . But if your minds made up I won't try to persuade you.
JON,May I ask Your Grace how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?
STANNIS,Are you bored of us already?
JON,You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.
STANNIS,I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.
JON,And the wildlings?
STANNIS,They'd rather burn than fight for me so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them that's the safest course. . Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead.
JON,Most of the brothers yes. There's little love for the free folk here. .
STANNIS,You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.Stannis begins to leave. Olly opens the door.
STANNIS,You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of  Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
JON,I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.
STANNIS,Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.Stannis leaves. Davos begins to leave but turns to Jon as Jon begins to pace.
DAVOS,He sees something in you. . Might not be apparent from his tone but it's the truth. He believes in you.
JON,I'm sorry I disappointed him.Davos walks forward and takes a seat. Olly closes the door again.
DAVOS,The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.
JON,As long as he's ruling them.
DAVOS,He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.
JON,Ive sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.
DAVOS,Have you now? . How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.Olly looks to Jon. Jon looks at him crosses his arms and nods.
OLLY,Night gathers and now my watch begins -
DAVOS,Not that bit the bit at the end.OLLY: I'm the sword in the darkness the watcher on the walls the shield that guards the realm of men. I pledge my life -
DAVOS,Wait that's enough. <93>The shield that guards the realm of men.<94> That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck getting your boots dirty and doing what needs to be doing.
JON,And what needs to be done?
DAVOS,As long as the Boltons rule the North  the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion.Davos nods and turns to leave. Olly opens the door for him. Jon sits at his desk and sighs.CUT TO: BRAAVOSINT. ARYAS ROOMArya lays on her bed playing with her coin in her hand. Suddenly the door opens and she sits up.

WAIF,Who are you?
ARYA,What?
WAIF,You who walk in here with a coin you never earned whose value you do not respect. . Who are you?
ARYA,. No one.The waif quickly swings her cane at Arya hitting her arm. Arya now on her feet turns to face the waif holding her arm in pain.
ARYA,Ow! Cunt!
WAIF,A lie a sad little lie. Who are you?
ARYA,I told you I'm no - . Do that again and -The waif hits her a third time sending her to the ground.
WAIF,Who are you?
ARYA,You're about to find out.Arya reaches for her sword. Before she can pick it up Jaqen appears.
JAQEN,What are you doing?
WAIF,We were only playing. The game of faces.
JAQEN,A girl is not ready.
WAIF,Clearly not.
ARYA,. I am ready.
JAQEN,For what? For whatever you want. To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.The waif turns to her. Jaqen looks at the sword on Aryas bed.
JAQEN,Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark. Arya Stark's sword Arya Stark's clothes Arya Stark's stolen silver. A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?The waif looking smug leaves.EXT. DOCKOn a dock near the house of Black and White Arya wraps a rock in her clothes. She is wearing new clothes similar to the ones the waif wears. She ties them up and drops them into the water the rock causing them to sink. She picks up her coin purse and throws it in the water. After a moment of examining her original coin in her hand she throws it in the water as well. She looks at her sword Needle for a moment and then picks it up. She prepares to throw it in the sea
ARYA,What do we do with them after we wash them?The waif only looks up and smiles lightly making no other response. She goes back to washing him and Arya wets a rag of her own to help.CUT TO: WINTERFELLEXT. COURTYARD

Alliser stands in his way for a moment. Jon looks at the confrontation worried. Alliser raises his eyebrows for a moment and moves out of the way. Janos looks at him shocked. Edd grabs Janos and some other men assist in dragging him outside.
JANOS,You cannot do this! Get your hands off me! . Scum all of you! If the boy thinks he can frighten me he's mistaken yes very mistaken.Someone puts a chopping block down. Janos is taken up to it.

HIGH SEPTON,Yes yes.Olyvar snaps his fingers. He and five of the prostitutes step aside. The two dressed as the Maiden and the Stranger remain and approach the High Septon who smiles. Suddenly some men led by Lancel Lannister barge into the room. The High Septon gasps and turns around.
OLYVAR,What are you doing? This establishment belong to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't -The men force the High Septon to his feet. One of the men rips off Olyvars fake beard hits him to the ground and begins kicking him. The prostitutes run out of the room.

HIGH SEPTON,uh<85>
QYBURN,It doesn't matter. .
HIGH SEPTON,As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world. An insult to me is an insult to the Gods. An assault on my person is an assault on our very religion.
CERSEI,You were assaulted?
HIGH SEPTON,I was by those fanatics who call themselves <91>sparrows. They humiliated me they they beat me they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones. I am lucky to be alive.
QYBURN,I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.
MACE,High Septon this is a rather shocking thing to hear.
HIGH SEPTON,I tend to both the highest born and the lowliest amongst us. Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother.
QYBURN,So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?
PYCELLE,A man's private affairs ought to stay private!
CERSEI,What do you want from us High Septon?
HIGH SEPTON,Justice! I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells. I ask that you execute their leader this so-called High Sparrow. He's a threat to everything we hold sacred. If he goes unpunished -
CERSEI,And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?EXT. STREETA soldier helps Cersei out of her carriage. She begins walking forward. Ser Meryn stands ahead of her.
MERYN,I don't think this is a good idea Your Grace.
CERSEI,Nonsense Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. . Where can I find the High Sparrow?The man points up the stairs. They are crowded with people. Cersei and Ser Meryn ascend them.
MAN 1,Seven blessings.Cersei covers her nose. At the top of the stairs is a large room. She watches as many people eat at tables.
MAN 2,Thank you.
MAN 3,Just a little more...
WOMAN,Thank you ever so for the soup!In the center of the room an old man is giving soup to people in line. Cersei approaches him.
CERSEI,A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?
HIGH SPARROW,High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling or King Turtle. . The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some so they belittle me.
WOMAN 2,Seven blessings to you.
HIGH SPARROW,Seven blessings to you my dear. It's only a name quite an easy burden to wear. Far easier than hers. .
CERSEI,Why no shoes?
HIGH SPARROW,Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are.
CERSEI,Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?
HIGH SPARROW,Everyone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself. Oh I tell them no one's special. And they think I'm special for telling them so.
CERSEI,. Perhaps they're right.
HIGH SPARROW,It would be comforting to believe that wouldn't it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me. For that incident with the High Septon.
CERSEI,An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world wouldn't you say?
HIGH SPARROW,Hypocrisy is a boil. Lancing a is never pleasant. Although they could have been more careful with the blade.
CERSEI,The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you he wants me to execute you.
HIGH SPARROW,I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.

QYBURN,Shh. Easy friend.CUT TO: WINTERFELLCOURTYARDSansa walks through the busy courtyard. Theon is shoveling dirt nearby. He looks up to see her walking in his direction and looks away tense. On a platform above Ramsay and Baelish stand watching her.
RAMSAY,She really is lovely. I hope I can make her happy.
BAELISH,I hope so too. I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together. Shes suffered enough.
RAMSAY,I'll never hurt her. You have my word.
BAELISH,I've heard very little about you. Which makes you quite a rare thing as lords go.
RAMSAY,I haven't been a lord very long. I was a bastard.
ROOSE,. And you're not anymore. Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.
RAMSAY,Yes father. And thank you Lord Baelish. I'm forever in your debt. .
BAELISH,He seems pleased.
ROOSE,Shouldn't he be?
BAELISH,. I assure you she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land she's no man's wife. Inspect her if you must.
ROOSE,I leave that to the brothel keeper. It's her name I need not her virtue.
BAELISH,Then I have delivered everything I've promised.
ROOSE,And you prepared for the consequences. When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.BAELISH: The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him Jaime has one hand and no allies Tommen is a soft boy not a king to fear.
ROOSE,The Queen will be enraged.
BAELISH,Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother a title whose importance wanes with each passing day.
ROOSE,And yet she still has friends. Men in important places whom she can ask for favours. . A message for you from Cersei Lannister. A rider arrived from Eyrie shortly before dawn. Apparently she thinks you're still in the Vale.
BAELISH,A message for me you say. Strange that the seal is broken.
ROOSE,I'm sure you understand my position Lord Baelish. If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros. Yet here you are in the North undermining them. Why gamble with your position?
BAELISH,Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.
ROOSE,I had Tywin Lannister backing. Who supports me now? You?
BAELISH,The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply.

KINGSGUARD,You'll be sending them to meet the Gods that they love.The kingsguard and militants both adjust their stances ready for a fight. A number of other people begin to watch. Some people begin yelling at Tommen.
MAN 1,Bastard!
MAN 2,You're an abomination!
MAN 3,You're born of sin!
WOMAN,Filthy bastard!

MAN 4,Abomination!INT. TOMMENS CHAMBERSTommen opens the doors to his chambers finding it empty.
TOMMEN,My Queen?Margaery enters from outside.
TOMMEN,There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence.
MARGAERY,You're the King of the Andals the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms the Protector of the Realm. And you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law.
TOMMEN,I'm going to speak to the High Sparrow.
MARGAERY,Are you? When?
TOMMEN,I--I don't know.
MARGAERY,You don't know?
TOMMEN,He was praying just now.

TOMMEN,Of course.CUT TO: THE WALLEXT. CASTLE BLACKSome Nights Watchmen spar in the courtyard. A number of others look on. Stannis and Selyse watch from some stairs.
SELYSE,You think highly of this boy.
JON,. Good.
STANNIS,Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.SELYSE: A bastard by some tavern slut.
STANNIS,Perhaps but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.
SELYSE,I should have given you a son.
STANNIS,Not your fault.
SELYSE,Whose then? .
MELISANDRE,. Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.
SELYSE,My Lady.
MELISANDRE,Her father is the Lord's chosen King. And her father's blood runs through her veins.Melisandre and Selyse stare at each other. After a moment Selyse walks away.
MELISANDRE,You march on Winterfell soon?
STANNIS,We must. To beat the snows.
MELISANDRE,Once before you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind. I hope you won't make that mistake again.
STANNIS,I won't. I need you.
MELISANDRE,You only need faith my King.
STANNIS,. And you my Lady what do you need?
MELISANDRE,To serve my Lord.Stannis turns back. They both watch Jon sparring.INT. JONS CHAMBERJon sits at his desk. Sam hands him various letters to sign one by one.
SAM,Lord Ashford. . Lord Smallwood.
JON,Never even heard of these people.
SAM,They haven't heard of you either. . But we need men and they have some.
JON,And how many men does this Lord Maison have to send us?
SAM,. More than Lord Weebly.Sams face grows dark after reading the next letter. When Jon finishes signing the letter to Lord Weebly Sam hands it to him saying nothing. Jon begins signing but hesitates.
JON,Not him.
SAM,I know I'm sorry but we need men and supplies. And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North.
JON,He murdered my brother.
SAM,We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall. We can't watch the Wall with 50 men. And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.Jon hesitates another moment and then relents and signs the letter. He leans his chair back and Sam gathers up all of the signed letters. He walks away almost bumping into Melisandre as she enters Jons chambers.
SAM,Apologies my Lady.Sam and Melisandre both look at Jon. Jon nods at Sam and he leaves. Melisandre closes the door behind him and Jon straightens up his posture.
MELISANDRE,Lord Commander.
JON,How can I help you?
MELISANDRE,Come with us when we ride south. .
JON,Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.MELISANDRE: There's only one war. Life against death. Come. Let me show what you're fighting for. .
JON,You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me my Lady. But I don't trust in visions.
MELISANDRE,No visions. No magic. Just life.She opens up her robes naked underneath. She leans back and takes Jons hand slowly leading it up her body to cup her breast.
MELISANDRE,Do you feel my heart beating? This power in you you resist it and that's your mistake. Embrace it.Melisandre smiles and looks down at Jons hand. Jon looks too. Realizing that she is no longer holding it there he quickly pulls it away. Melisandre caresses Jons face and sits on his lap.
MELISANDRE,The Lord of Light made us male and female. Two parts of a greater whole. We are joining this power. Power to make life power to make light and power to cast shadows.
JON,I don't think Stannis would like that very much.
MELISANDRE,Then we shouldn't tell him. .
JON,I can't.MELISANDRE: Why?
JON,I swore a vow. . I loved another.
MELISANDRE,The dead don't need lovers. Only the living.Jon keeps her from unbuttoning his coat any further breathing heavily.
JON,I know. But I still love her.Melisandre stands up closes her robes and walks away. After opening the door to leave she turns to Jon.
MELISANDRE,You know nothing Jon Snow.Jons mouth opens a bit. She smirks and leaves.INT. STANNISS ROOMStannis sits at his desk reading something. Theres a knock at the door. After a moment Shireen enters. Stannis looks up at her and then back down at his reading material. She closes the door. She smiles but after Stannis doesnt return her smile she walks over to a nearby dresser and begins playing with the objects on top of it.
STANNIS,Are you lonely?
SHIREEN,. Just bored.
STANNIS,My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.
SHIREEN,. Were you bored a lot too?
STANNIS,I know Castle Black is no place for a child but I -
SHIREEN,I like it. .
STANNIS,Why do you say that?
SHIREEN,"She told me ""I don't want to bring you.""Shireen fiddles with the objects in her hands. Stannis looks down."
STANNIS,She shouldn't have said that.Shireen puts down the objects she was playing with and turns to leave. Before opening the door she turns back to Stannis.
SHIREEN,Are you ashamed of me father?Stannis looks up surprised. He puts down what he was doing. Shireen looks down.
STANNIS,When you were an infant . Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men
BAELISH,I thought I might find you here. . Your Aunt Lyanna.
SANSA,Father never talked about her. Sometimes I'd find him down here lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful.
BAELISH,I saw her once. I was a boy living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King your father Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me a boy from nowhere with nothing to his name watching these legendary men
SANSA,Yes he chose her<85> and then he kidnapped her and raped her.
BAELISH,Come. .
SANSA,Dressed for riding?
BAELISH,I am.
SANSA,Where are you going?
BAELISH,King's Landing.
SANSA,King's Landing?
BAELISH,Cersei sent for me. . We must not let her sniff out any trouble.
SANSA,You can't leave me here!
BAELISH,I know how hard it is to live with people you despise believe me. But it won't be for long.
SANSA,How do you know?
BAELISH,. Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first he has to take Winterfell.
SANSA,You don't know that.
BAELISH,I do. Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. With the North behind him Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.
SANSA,You think he'll defeat the Boltons?
BAELISH,He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. . As it happens I am a betting man.
SANSA,And if you're right?
BAELISH,Stannis takes Winterfell he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim he names you Wardeness of the North.
SANSA,But I I wouldn't<85> Wardeness of the North
BAELISH,You are the last surviving Stark. He needs you.
SANSA,What if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell or he does and the Boltons defeat him?
BAELISH,Then you will take this Bolton boy Ramsay and make him yours.
SANSA,I don't know how to do that.
BAELISH,Of course you do. He's already fallen for you.
SANSA,His father frightens me.
BAELISH,He should he's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And youve learnt to maneuver from the very best. . The North will be yours. Do you believe me?
SANSA,I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.Baelish chuckles and pats her shoulder. He turns and leaves as Sansa watches him.CUT TO: DORNEEXT. BOATAt night Bronn and Jaime sit in a boat. Bronn rows to shore alone. Looking across at Jaime Jaime holds up his fake hand. Bronn begrudgingly goes back to rowing alone. After they get to shore they carry their boat in and hide it in some tall grass. They then both walk away.EXT. DESERT - THE NEXT MORNINGJaime awakens to find Bronn standing over him with a knife. His eyes widens and he moves to the side as Bronn brings his knife down on a snake that was about to bite Jaime. Jaime looks at the snake and Bronn pulls his knife out of it.
BRONN,Breakfast.Bronn and Jaime sit at a fire. Bronn cooks the snake while Jaime puts gloves on.
BRONN,That would have been a shit way to die.
JAIME,As far as I've seen they're all shit ways to die.
BRONN,Aye. But your lot like to give the singers a good ending.
JAIME,I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.
BRONN,No? Two knights off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me.
JAIME,Sounds like all the rest.While Bronn is distracted eating Jaime gets rid of his food.JAIME: What about you? What shit way would you choose?
BRONN,In my own keep drinking my own wine watching my sons grovel for my fortune.
JAIME,How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.
BRONN,I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?
JAIME,In the arms of the woman I love.
BRONN,She want the same thing?
JAIME,Let's go.They both get up and gather their things. Bronn stomps out the fire. The scene cuts to them walking through some tall grass later.
BRONN,The captain to that ship<85> What was he Braavosi?
JAIME,Pentoshi.
BRONN,And he's headed to Oldtown?
JAIME,As I said. Why?
BRONN,What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?
JAIME,A bag of gold.
BRONN,I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.
JAIME,It was a heavy bag.
BRONN,And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks them.A horse neighs in the distance. Jaime looks around. A group of Dornish riders approach. Bronn and Jaime hide in the grass. Jaime watches the riders.
BRONN,How many you count?
JAIME,Four.
BRONN,How many you think you can take?
JAIME,One if he's slow.Bronn turns to look at the riders.
RIDER,Halt!The rider holds up his hand and the party stops having spotted Jaime and Bronns footsteps.
BRONN,Fucked in the arse. . Morning lads. Glad we found you.
RIDER,Who are you?
BRONN,Cooper. . This is Darnell.
RIDER,You're from King's Landing.
BRONN,Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.
RIDER,Why are you here?
BRONN,Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing really.
JAIME,I thought the sharks would get us. .
RIDER,There are no sharks in Dorne.
JAIME,I could have sworn those were shark fins.
BRONN,Dolphins maybe.
RIDER,Throw your swords in the sand.
BRONN,Boys there's no need for this. Just point us in the right direction. We'll find our way home.
RIDER,Swords in the sand! Now!Bronn and Jaime look at each other. They pull out their swords. Bronn puts his down in the sand and then flings a knife into the throat of a rider. He then kills another stabbing him and knocking him off of his horse. A third charges him and Bronn knocks him off of his horse as well. However he survives. Bronn turns to Jaime.
BRONN,That one should be slow enough.Bronn approaches the fourth and final rider. Jaime turns to the injured rider who is revealed to be much larger than Jaime. They begin fighting. In the background Bronn knocks the fourth rider off of his horse. As Jaime and the man fight Jaime is slowly pushed back down a hill. He falls over and begins rolling to escape his attacker. He loses his balance and his sword is knocked away. As the attacker brings his sword down to kill Jaime Jaime brings his gold hand up to block it. The sword gets stuck in Jaimes hand. As the attacker is stuck trying to remove the sword Jaime picks his back up kills him
BRONN,Nice move! .
JAIME,Luck.
BRONN,You had a wonderful teacher.Bronn turns and walks away. Jaime looks back down the hill and then to his hand. Failing to shake the sword off he is forced to dislodge it by kicking it out of his own hand. Bronn is then seen cleaning his sword off on the clothes of one of the dead riders. He sheaths his sword as Jaime approaches.
BRONN,Always wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.JAIME: First we need to bury these bodies.
BRONN,Birds have to eat too.
JAIME,Corpses raise questions questions raise armies. We're not here to start a war.
BRONN,Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?
JAIME,. I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all really.Jaime walks away as Bronns face drops. He begins dragging a body.EXT. BEACHElaria in all black swiftly rides down a beach on horseback. She approaches a tent. Nearby are some more horses and in the tent are Nymeria Obara and Tyene. Tyene exits the tent to meet her as she dismounts.
TYENE,Nama!Tyene and Elaria embrace.
ELARIA,Nym Obara.
OBARA,Will it be war?
ELARIA,Prince Doran will weep for your father but nothing else. We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.
OBARA,Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters.ELARIA: We don't need an army to start a war. . Queen Cersei loves her children and we have one of them.
NYMERIA,We may have a problem.Nymeria uses a whip to knock a bucket away. Underneath is the captain who brought Jaime and Bronn to Dorne buried neck-deep in sand and covered in scorpions.
OBARA,A ship's captain who found me in Planky Town claiming he had information to sell. He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne.
ELARIA,He's come for Myrcella. If he gets to her before we do we lose our only chance for revenge. You must choose. Doran's way and peace or my way and war.TYENE: .
ELARIA,Nym? . Obara?
OBARA,When I was a child  Oberyn came to take me to court. I'd never seen this man and yet he called himself my father. My mother wept said I was too young and a girl.
OBARA,. I made my choice long ago.Elaria and Tyene smile.CUT TO: EXT. BOAT AT SEAJorah steers the boat as Tyrion tied up and gagged tries to speak. He only succeeds in mumbling. Eventually he stops trying to say real words and instead only tries to be as loud as possible to annoy Jorah. Jorah comes over and ungags him and then walks back over to continue steering.
TYRION,Thank you. . Who are you?
JORAH,Your captor.
TYRION,Do you have wine?
JORAH,No.
TYRION,I can't sleep without wine.
JORAH,Then stay awake.
TYRION,You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.
JORAH,I'm not taking you to your sister.
TYRION,You said you were taking me to the Queen.
JORAH,I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the Queen I serve.
TYRION,. What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!
JORAH,What business would you have with the Queen?
TYRION,Gold and glory. Oh and hate. If you've ever met my sister you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? . A high born knight from the North of Westeros down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how exactly were you serving your Queen in a whore house half a world away? Is it possible that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh
DAENERYS,Everyone looks happy enough from up here. . What?
BARRISTAN,I was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep into the streets of King's Landing.
DAENERYS,Why?
BARRISTAN,He liked to walk among the people he liked to sing to them.
DAENERYS,He sang to them?
BARRISTAN,Yes. Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing. Just like all the other minstrels.
DAENERYS,And what did you do?
BARRISTAN,I made sure no one killed him. And I collected the money. . Well he liked to see how much he could make.
DAENERYS,He was good?
BARRISTAN,He was very good. Viserys never told you?
DAENERYS,He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. .
BARRISTAN,Rhaegar never liked killing. He loved singing.
DAENERYS,And what did you do with the money?
BARRISTAN,Well one time he gave it to the next minstrel down the street. One time he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom. One time... we got horribly drunk. .
DARIO,. Your Grace. Hizdahr is here waiting in your audience chamber.
DAENERYS,How many others are there?
DARIO,Fifty a hundred.
DAENERYS,Will you be joining us Ser Barristan?
DARIO,I think I can protect you from Hizdahr Zo Loraq.
DAENERYS,I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me.
BARRISTAN,Your Grace. .INT. AUDIENCE CHAMBER
HIZDAHR,All men must die. But not all can die in glory.
MISSANDEI,Glory?
HIZDAHR,Why else do men fight? Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms? So their names would live on. Those who find victory in the fighting pits will never become kings but their names will live on. It's the best chance they'll ever have.
DAENERYS,Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?
HIZDAHR,Your Grace today is the traditional start of the fighting season.
DAENERYS,I do not recognize this tradition.
HIZDAHR,Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city your city together. . Without them former slaves and former masters have nothing in common. Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment. I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems but it's a start.EXT. MARKETPLACEA prostitute and a soldier laugh with each other. Another soldier talks with some women. Some Sons of the Harpy kill all of the soldiers in the area causing panic. In a nearby alley some Unsullied march. Hearing the chaos they begin running towards the market. They find the prostitute crying over the body of the dead soldier.
WOMAN,Sons of the Harpy.She gestures in the direction the sons went. The Unsullied run in that direction. When they are out of view she stops her act and wipes the tears away. The Unsullied enter a corridor expecting to catch the sons. Instead they themselves are ambushed from every direction by Sons of the Harpy. After a tense few moments a fight breaks out. During the fight one of the Unsullieds helmet is knocked off and is revealed to be Grey Worm. Another fight breaks out elsewhere. The two Unsullied there are killed almost immediately. Barristan walks down an alley and upon noticing the chaos
HIZDAHR,I am so sorry my queen. He was a good man.
DAENERYS,"""Barristan the Bold"" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley butchered by cowards who hide behind masks."
DAARIO,We could pull back to the pyramid district secure it and use it as a base from which to operate. Then we clean the city out neighborhood by neighborhood
DAENERYS,I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.
HIZDAHR,But... I'm the leader of my family.Daario nods. The two men behind Hizdahr grab and restrain him. He is taken away.
HIZDAHR,No Your Grace! I had nothing to do with this. Your Grace!INT. DRAGON CHAMBERDaenerys Daario some Unsullied
DAENERYS,Walk forward.The Unsullied lower their spears at the other men.
MAN,You cannot do this.The Unsullied begin walking forward forcing the men to move. After a few moments they stop. Chains rattle again.
DAENERYS,Another step.The Unsullied and the men take another step. Chains rattle and an unseen dragon snarls. Daenerys walks through the Unsullied to the front of the group.
DAENERYS,. But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must.Daenerys looks at Daario. He walks over and pushes the mumbling man forward onto his knees.
DAENERYS,But she does not give up on them.The mans eyes widen. A dragon comes out of the shadows and breathes fire on him. He screams and dies. The dragons take his corpse tear it in two and eat it.
DAENERYS,
HIZDAHR,All men must die.The other men besides Hizdahr grovel before Daenerys. The dragons continue eating. After a moment she takes her hand off of Hizdahr.
DAENERYS,Don't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps.Daario and the Unsullied take the men out. Daenerys watches her dragons eat for a moment and then walks out herself.CUT TO: CASTLE BLACKINT. LIBRARYSam sits at a table reading a letter. Aemon is with him.
SAM,"""And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay forces rise against her from within and without. She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure."" She sounds like quite a woman."
AEMON,And she's alone under siege no family to guide her or protect her. Her last relation thousands of miles away useless
SAM,Don't say that Maester Aemon.
AEMON,A Targaryen alone in the world is a terrible thing.Jon walks in.
JON,Maester Aemon.
AEMON,Lord Commander.
JON,Sam I'd like to speak to the maester alone.Sam gets up grabs his papers and leaves. Jon walks over and sits at the table.
JON,How are you feeling?
AEMON,Oh like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death.
JON,I need your advice. There's something I want to do something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order.
AEMON,Half the men hate you already Lord Commander. Do it.
JON,But you don't know what it is.
AEMON,That doesn't matter. You do. You will find little joy in your command. But with luck you will find the strength to do what needs to be done. Kill the boy Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy and let the man be born.INT. ROOMJon and Tormund sit across from each other at a table.
JON,Where are the rest of the free folk now? . Who leads them?
TORMUND,They followed Mance. They won't follow anyone else.
JON,What about you?
TORMUND,Hard to lead when you're in chains.
JON,What if I unchained you?
TORMUND,Why would you do that?
JON,Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.
TORMUND,You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.
JON,For 8 000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8 000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you.
TORMUND,And now everything is going to change?
JON,It is.
TORMUND,Why now?
JON,Because now  I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
TORMUND,What would you have me do  Lord Commander?
JON,. I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.
TORMUND,They won't kneel for you and neither will I.
JON,I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.
TORMUND,The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.
JON,And how many of your people can't fight? The women the children the old the sick
TORMUND,. Easy thing to say to a man in chains.Jon unchains Tormund. Tormunds eyes widen as he feels his hands.
JON,Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.
TORMUND,Most of them are at Hardhome. You know where that is?
JON,Up on Storrold's Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.
TORMUND,We'll need ships.
JON,I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.
TORMUND,All right then. You're coming with me. You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. They need to hear it from you. They need to know the ships they are boarding wont be torched in the middle of the sea. You come with me or I don't go.INT. DINING HALLThe Nights Watchmen present talk amongst themselves. Stannis and Davos are present. Jon stands at a table in the front of the room with Allister and two others. One of them addresses Jon.
MAN 1,You'd bring wildlings here through our gates?
JON,Men women and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing.
MAN 1,Let them die. We got our own to worry about. Less enemies for us.Some of the men in the crowd cheer.
STANNIS,Fewer.
DAVOS,What?
STANNIS,Nothing.
SAM,. Land that no one uses now. A dozen abandoned villages.
MAN 2,And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years. Cut them down! Just like they did this boy's people.The man points to Olly who lowers his head. Sam sits down.
ALLISTER,We've been fighting them all for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers.
JON,And we've slaughtered theirs.
EDD,I will follow you anywhere you know that. But they killed Grenn. And they killed Pyp. . They killed 50 of our brothers. I can't forget that. I can't forgive it.
JON,You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now they're better than that.The men in the room return to bickering loudly.INT. LORD COMMANDERS ROOMJon walks in takes off his coat
JON,Thank you. . If you have something you want to say to me say it. It's all right.
OLLY,You don't mean it do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them.
JON,It's not a trick.
OLLY,They burned my village. They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me. They butchered my mother everyone I ever knew.
JON,I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.
OLLY,Will there be anything else you need Lord Commander?
JON,No.Olly leaves. Jon sighs.CUT TO: WINTERFELLEXT. COURTYARDPodrick walks carrying some supplies. He enters a building. Inside Brienne stares out of a window. Podrick sets down the supplies.

BRIENNE,Thank you. You've lived here a long time?
MAN,Aye.
BRIENNE,Did you know Lord Eddard?
MAN,I knew him and his father before him. The Starks are gone now.
BRIENNE,Not all of them. I know who's inside that castle.
MAN,Everyone knows. The Boltons.
BRIENNE,I'm not talking about the Boltons. I need to get a message to her. To Sansa Stark.
MAN,Who are you?
BRIENNE,Someone who swore to keep her safe.
MAN,Swore to who?

RAMSAY,Come back here. Myranda.
MYRANDA,I saw you staring at her.
RAMSAY,I'm going to marry her. That will involve looking at her from time to time.
MYRANDA,You said you'd marry me.
RAMSAY,And I meant it. When I was a bastard named Snow. But I'm a Bolton now. What I want is no longer the primary consideration. I'm furthering a dynasty.
MYRANDA,Do you think she's pretty?
RAMSAY,Of course I do. I'm not blind.Ramsay sighs and gets up. He walks over to Myranda and grabs her waist.
RAMSAY,You think she's pretty too. I'm looking forward to our wedding night. But don't worry I'll have plenty of time for you.
MYRANDA,Perhaps I'll marry too.
RAMSAY,. You're mine. You're not going anywhere. Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy. Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me. You're not going to bore me are you
MYRANDA,. Never.Ramsay smiles back. They begin having sex.INT. SANSAS CHAMBERSSansa sits alone at a table. Theres a knock on the door. She turns gets up and opens it. An old servant woman comes in.

SANSA,My mother. .
MYRANDA,I'm sorry for what happened to her.
SANSA,Thank you.
MYRANDA,It's good that she taught you. It was a gift. Now every time you wear something you made you can remember her.
SANSA,I'd rather have a mother.
MYRANDA,I know. It's not the same. Still it's good to remember. Remember the way things were. I almost forgot. There's something else to help you remember.INT. DUNGEON ENTRANCEMyranda opens the gate and lets Sansa in. Some dogs bark.
MYRANDA,Down there at the end.
SANSA,What is it?
MYRANDA,That would spoil the surprise. Go ahead it's perfectly safe. You won't believe it when you see it.The dogs continue barking and growling. Sansa walks down the aisle of cages. Most contain dogs. Sansa looks behind to see Myranda has disappeared. She comes to the last cage which is open. Inside is Theon on the floor. He gets up and notices her.
SANSA,Theon?
THEON,You shouldn't be here.She looks at him angrily. He backs away from her. She leaves.INT. RAMSAYS CHAMBERSTheon unties Ramsays jacket.

RAMSAY,She saw you?
THEON,Yes. I'm sorry master. Forgive me. I didn't think -
RAMSAY,Come here.Theon walks forward. Ramsay holds his chin.
RAMSAY,You mustn't keep secrets from me Reek. Get on your knees.Theon gets on his knees. Ramsay sips his wine and then puts it aside. Theon looks down.
RAMSAY,Give me your hand.Theon hesitantly holds his hand up. As Ramsay takes it Theon begins stammering. After a moment Ramsay cups Theons hand with his own hands.
RAMSAY,I forgive you.Theon looks up. Ramsay smiles.INT. DINING HALLSansa Ramsay Roose and Walda sit at a table
ROOSE,I trust you find your chamber suitable my lady.

WALDA,Thank you Ramsay.He pours her some wine as well. She smiles. Ramsay gets up and holds his wine up.
RAMSAY,My lady we are all a family we northerners. Our blood ties go back thousands of years. So I'd like to drink to our wedding. May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin to the Last Hearth.
ROOSE,. To your wedding.
WALDA,. To your wedding.Ramsay takes a large sip of wine. Sansa puts her own glass down. Ramsay sits down.
WALDA,It must be difficult for you being in a strange place.
SANSA,This isn't a strange place. This is my home. It's the people who are strange.
RAMSAY,You're right. Very strange. More wine please.Theon enters the room with some wine. Sansa looks away.
RAMSAY,I heard you two had reunited. A fitting place for it. . I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room. Are you still angry with him after he - what he did? Don't worry. The North remembers. I punished him for it. He's not ironborn anymore. Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. He's a new man. A new person anyway. Aren't you Reek?
THEON,. Yes master.
RAMSAY,That's his new name Reek.
SANSA,Why are you doing this?
RAMSAY,"Because Reek has something to say to you. Don't you Reek? . An apology. Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did. Apologize for murdering her two brothers.Theon shakes his head ""no"" when Ramsay looks away"
THEON,. I'm sorry.
RAMSAY,Look at her Reek. An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye.
THEON,I'm sorry.
RAMSAY,Sorry about what?
THEON,For killing your brothers.
RAMSAY,There over and done with. Doesn't everyone feel better? I do. That was getting very tense. Whew. . You know what my lady? What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left. Reek. You will give away the bride. Someone has to. What better person? Good? Good?
ROOSE,Yes yes very good.
RAMSAY,Wonderful. .
ROOSE,Walda and I have some good news as well since we're all together.
WALDA,We're going to have a baby.
SANSA,I'm very happy for you.ROOSE: From the way she's carrying Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy.Ramsay sips some wine and angrily sets his cup down. Sansa looks at him smugly.INT. ROOSES WAR ROOMRamsay and Roose sit at a war table.
RAMSAY,How can you be sure?
ROOSE,Sure of what?
RAMSAY,That she's pregnant. I mean how can you tell?
ROOSE,Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.Ramsay gets up and walks around to the other side of the table wine in hand.
RAMSAY,So how did you manage it?
ROOSE,Manage what?
RAMSAY,Getting her pregnant.
ROOSE,I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.
RAMSAY,Of course but how did you find it?
ROOSE,You disgraced yourself at dinner parading that creature before the Stark girl.
RAMSAY,And if it's a boy?
ROOSE,You're worried about your position.
RAMSAY,My position is quite clear. I'm your son until a better alternative comes along.Ramsay finished his wine and goes to get more.ROOSE: You've never asked me about your mother.
RAMSAY,Why would I? She had me she died. And here we are.
ROOSE,She was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. . Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him?
RAMSAY,Yes.CUT TO: CASTLE BLACKINT. LIBRARYGilly walks through the bookshelves examining them. Sam sits at the table reading.
GILLY,Is this every book there is?
SAM,Every book there is?
GILLY,In the world.
SAM,Well no. There are thousands and thousands of books out there. This library is rather small actually.
GILLY,Where you grew up were there more books?
SAM,My father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.
GILLY,Where's that?
SAM,The Citadel? In Oldtown.
GILLY,I'm sorry I don't know things.
SAM,Gilly look at me. You know how to do a hundred things I can never do. You can build a fire with wet wood. You can cook. You can stitch a wound.
GILLY,I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.
SAM,Well -
GILLY,Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?
SAM,It's where they train the maesters.
GILLY,Like Maester Aemon?
SAM,I wanted to be one when I was young. Instead I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you.Stannis enters the library. Sam stands up.
SAM,Ah Your Grace.Gilly quickly exits.
STANNIS,You're Samwell Tarly?
SAM,I am Your Grace.
STANNIS,Your father is Randyll Tarly. He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford. Only battle Robert ever lost. I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon but he never listened. Fine soldier your father. You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker.
SAM,I did Your Grace.
STANNIS,How?
SAM,With a dagger made of dragonglass.
STANNIS,Dragonglass?
SAM,What the maesters call obsidian -
STANNIS,I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?
SAM,I don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass.
STANNIS,The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.
SAM,I've seen it Your Grace.
STANNIS,Seen what?SAM: The army of the dead. And when they come -
STANNIS,We have to know how to fight them. . Keep reading Samwell Tarly.Stannis leaves.INT. DINING HALLDavos carves away at a piece of wood. Stannis approaches him.
STANNIS,It's time.
DAVOS,Uh Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings we could have thousands more men.
STANNIS,If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings. We can't wait that long. We have the advantage more men more horses all fed and rested. But every day we wait
DAVOS,I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.
STANNIS,No need they're coming with us.
DAVOS,It's a tough road ahead Your Grace. Won't they be safer -
STANNIS,Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists. No they march with us.They walk outside.
DAVOS,As you wish Your Grace.Stannis walks away. Davos spots Melisandre.EXT. COURTYARD - THE NEXT MORNINGStanniss men prepare to ride out. Sam and Gilly watch. Gilly holds baby Sam. Olly Edd and some other watchmen are also shown watching.
SHIREEN,. Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?
DAVOS,Beg your pardon?
SHIREEN,At Winterfell. All the Kings in the North are buried there. Bran the Builder and King Dorren and-
DAVOS,First things first. It's a long march ahead. And then we have to take the castle.
SHIREEN,Is there going to be a battle?
DAVOS,Aye princess but you won't be anywhere near -
SELYSE,That's enough talk of battle Ser Davos. You'll scare the child.
DAVOS,Yes my queen.
SHIREEN,I'm not scared.
DAVOS,Well I am. When the battle comes promise you'll protect me.
SHIREEN,. I promise.Shireen looks back at Gilly. Selyse catches her and she looks down and away. Jon walks through the courtyard. He and Stannis meet on some stairs.
STANNIS,I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings. I need those ships.
JON,You'll get them back I swear it. Have a safe journey Your Grace. And thank you.Jon watches Stannis walk away and get on his horse. He makes eye contact with Melisandre but she looks away.

MISSANDEI,Three days.He looks at her. His face is bruised.
GREY WORM,Ser Barristan?Missandei shakes her head.
GREY WORM,I failed him. I failed my men I failed my queen.
MISSANDEI,Are you ashamed? You were ambushed outnumbered. There was no way you could have known.
GREY WORM,This is not why. Wounded in war there is no shame for this. I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground I am afraid.
MISSANDEI,All men fear death.
GREY WORM,No not death. I fear I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath.Missandei looks down on the verge of tears. She gets up and lies down in the bed with him caressing his face
MISSANDEI,Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.
DAENERYS,If I give everyone what they deserve I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think?
MISSANDEI,Your Grace I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters.
DAENERYS,. You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think?
MISSANDEI,I can only tell you what I have seen Your Grace. . I have seen you listen to your counselors. I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you. And I have seen you ignore your counselors because there was a better choice. One that only you could see.INT. DUNGEONSDaenerys is led by Unsullied to a room in a dungeon. The door is opened to reveal Hizdahr. She enters and he kneels before her.
HIZDAHR,My my queen please do not do this.
DAENERYS,"What about ""Valar Morghulis""?"
HIZDAHR,I did not want to die a coward. Apparently I do not want to die at all. .
DAENERYS,It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen not while I live.
HIZDAHR,Yes my queen.
DAENERYS,And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people I will marry the leader of an ancient family. . Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees.Hizdahr looks surprised. Daenerys faintly smiles and then leaves. Hizdahr is left in the cell with the door wide open.CUT TO: SEAEXT. JORAHS BOATTyrion wakes up and feels his head.
TYRION,Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. . Long sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen.
JORAH,We are.

JORAH,No wine.

JORAH,I am.
TYRION,Have you sailed this route before?
JORAH,No.
TYRION,You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?
JORAH,I think you'll be plenty.

JORAH,No. But the pirates are.
TYRION,Oh.EXT. RIVER SURROUNDED BY WOODS
TYRION,The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -
JORAH,And then they weren't.
TYRION,"And then they weren't. ""They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -"""
JORAH,"""The city of a thousand years and all that men had learned; The Doom consumed it all alike and neither of them turned."""
TYRION,I would clap.He holds up his bound hands. Jorah smirks.
TYRION,I suppose this is it then. This is what remains.They look at the approaching ruins of the city. Suddenly Tyrion spots Drogon passing overhead. He stands up. Both of them look up and watch as he passes. Behind Tyrion someone hops in the water. Jorah hears the splash and turns to see the ripples.
TYRION,What was that?The boat passes into a tunnel. A Stone Man jumps down into the boat from the ceiling.
JORAH,Stone Men! Don't let them touch you!Jorah hits the stone man from behind before he gets to Tyrion. They begin fighting. Another stone man jumps into the water and begins trying to get on the boat. Tyrion tries to keep him off. Jorah manages to push the first man into the water. He then begins fighting the other one.
JORAH,Get behind!
TYRION,Mormont cut me free! . Mormont!Jorah climbs back onto the boat and fights off the stone man. He manages to get his sword and cuts the stone man. The other stone man inches his way towards Tyrion.
TYRION,Mormont! Mormont!Jorah cuts through the stone man he was fighting and pushes him into the water. Tyrion rolls into the water to avoid the other one. He desperately tries to remove the rope around his hands. A stone man grabs his ankle and begins attempting to pull him down. The screen fades to black. After a few moments we see Tyrions perspective. Jorah stands over him as his eyes slowly blink open.EXT. SHORE
JORAH,. Tyrion? Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion. You're all right.Tyrion looks around. Jorah helps him up. He unsheathes his knife and cuts Tyrions binds.
JORAH,You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?
TYRION,. I've seen greyscale before but nothing like that.
JORAH,I suppose that's why they send them there.
TYRION,It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. . So what now?
JORAH,We walk up the coast. With luck we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat.
TYRION,Without luck?
JORAH,We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest huh?
TYRION,That's the best idea you've had all day.Jorah walks away. After looking out for a moment he stops and pulls up his sleeve. He examines his wrist which has the beginnings of greyscale. After a moment

TYRION,I believe in many things.
JORAH,In something greater than ourselves I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?
TYRION,No.
JORAH,Neither did I. I was a cynic just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought Id find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?
TYRION,No.
JORAH,It's hard to be a cynic after that.
TYRION,Doesnt mean shes going to be a great queen.

JORAH,First we have to conquer the world.
TYRION,We? Alright lets assume your dreams come true. Shes ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army sail to Westeros
JORAH,Then she rules.
TYRION,So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? Thats justice?
JORAH,She is the rightful heir.
TYRION,Why because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?Jorah sees a ship anchored in the middle of the sea and pushes Tyrion behind a rock.

MALKO,The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.The slavers get Jorah and Tyrion to their feet.
JORAH,Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.
MALKO,Were bound to Volantis not Slavers Bay. Besides she reopened the fighting pits. I never heard of free men fighting in the pits.
TYRION,The fighting puts in Mereen! Youre in luck then youre about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms.Malko looks at Tyrion and laughs.
TYRION,Him.
MALKO,Him? Hes got to be 60 years old.TYRION: Sure hes a bit long in the tooth a bit withered

MALKO,Jousting. Youre talking about jousting. A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole.
JORAH,I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat.Malko jumps up shocked and gets in Jorahs face.
MALKO,Liar.

CERSEI,If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?
BAELISH,Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.
CERSEI,Good.  If theres nothing else.
BAELISH,There is another matter your Grace. Something so urgent I couldnt trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive and well
CERSEI,Thats not possible.
BAELISH,My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son Ramsay a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen.
CERSEI,Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.
BAELISH,Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.
CERSEI,We were fools to trust a turncloak.
BAELISH,Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.
CERSEI,I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.
BAELISH,I would counsel patience your grace.
CERSEI,Patience? Sansa helped murder my son Roose Bolton is a traitor.
BAELISH,Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when theyre done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives.
CERSEI,Winterfell is 1 000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn.
BAELISH,That is why it is critical to strike soon while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force.
CERSEI,My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.
BAELISH,Ser Jaime then.
CERSEI,Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. Ive no idea when hell be back.
BAELISH,Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros trained to battle in the ice and the snow.
CERSEI,Forgive me Lord Baelish you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper not a military man.
BAELISH,You wouldnt risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose a brothel keeper?
CERSEI,And if you succeed?
BAELISH,Name me Warden of the North.
CERSEI,Ill speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.
BAELISH,Ill not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.
CERSEI,And Ill l know youre a man of your word when I see Sansa Starks head on a spike.
BAELISH,As I said. I live to serve.EXT. DORNE - GARDENTrystane puts a flower in Myrcellas hair.
TRYSTANE,Im going to ask him tomorrow.
MYRCELLA,What if he says no?
TRYSTANE,He wont. Youve waited long enough. I want you to be my wife now. What is it?
MYRCELLA,Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it or do you<85>Trystane kisses her in the middle of the sentence. Myrcella pushes him off.
MYRCELLA,We cant. Not yet.
TRYSTANE,Why not?
MYRCELLA,You know why not. Someone will see.
TRYSTANE,You are going to be my wife. I am going to be your husband. We are allowed to walk through the gardens together.
MYRCELLA,How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?
TRYSTANE,I like the way your eyes go squinty when youre jealous.
MYRCELLA,They dont go squinty and you didnt answer the question.Cut to Doran and Areo on the balcony.
DORAN,They make a lovely couple. A Lannister and a Martell. They have no idea how dangerous that is. We must protect them.
AREO,Yes my prince.
DORAN,You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time. I hope you remember how.
AREO,I remember how.EXT. DORNE - COUNTRYSIDEBRONN : The Dornishmans wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishmans blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishmans wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...
JAIME,Alright thats enough.
BRONN,Im coming to the best part.
JAIME,Were trying to blend in. We dont want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.
BRONN,This song really is all about the ending.
JAIME,It can wait. Up there.He spots a line of Dornishmen walking towards the Water Gardens.
JAIME,Thats the Water Gardens.
BRONN,Once we got the princess then what?
JAIME,I like to improvise.
BRONN,That explains the golden hand.EXT. DORNE - WATER GARDENSJaime and Bronn ride in behind common folk carrying meat and other goods. They break off from the pack.INT. SHADOWY ROOM

BRONN,Well shes made herself at home.They walk over.
JAIME,Myrcella.They stop kissing.
MYRCELLA,Uncle Jaime? I dont understand what are you doing here?
JAIME,Lets speak in private.
TRYSTANE,I am Trystane Martell.
MYRCELLA,Trystane is my intended.
JAIME,Excellent. Good to meet you.Jaime shakes hands with Trystane with his good hand.
TRYSTANE,We werent expecting you Ser Jaime.Bronn advances.
BRONN,Why dont you let them have some time alone son?Trystane inspects Bronns armor looking for a sigil.
BRONN,Lets not do something stupid.Trystane reaches for his sword and Bronn punches him across the face knocking him out.
MYRCELLA,No!
BRONN,That was something stupid.
JAIME,We have to go Myrcella now.
MYRCELLA,You hurt him!
JAIME,Youll be fine I promise but we have to--A whip wraps around Jaimes wrist. The Sand Snakes are here.
BRONN,Oh for fucks sake.The Sand Snakes attack Jaime and Bronn one wielding a spear one wielding a whip
OBARA,Youre coming with me.
MYRCELLA,I dont want to!
OBARA,I wasnt asking princess.Obara starts taking Myrcella out of the gardens. A Sand Snake cuts Bronns arm open. Areo and his men meet Obara as she escapes.
AREO,Drop you weapons!The rest of Areos men surround the Sand Snakes Bronn and Jaime.
OBARA,I am Obara Sand. Daughter of Oberyn Martell. I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?
AREO,Drop your weapons!The Snakes drop their weapons. Jaime stares down Areo sword still in hand. Areo puts his axe to Jaimes neck.
AREO,When you were whole it would have been a good fight.Jaime drops the sword Areos men grab him. Bronn drops his sword.
BRONN,You fight pretty good for a little girl.She screams at Bronn and is restrained by Areos men. They are all escorted away. The rest of Areos men corner Elaria in the room outside the Gardens.EXT. THE KINGSROADA carriage rides on the outskirts of Kings Landing.
RIDER,Halt!Cut to inside the carriage.
OLENNA,Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well why are we stopped go on.EXT. KINGS LANDING - GARDEN
OLENNA,Rumors and gossip thats all they got. Its theater nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in Kings Landing thered be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else.
MARGAERY,Everyone knew about him and Renly.
OLENNA,Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.
MARGAERY,But he was the kings brother.
OLENNA,And Loras is the queens brother. No no no
MARGAERY,Cersei is behind this.
OLENNA,Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest dear you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister.INT. CERSEIS ROOMCersei writes at her desk without acknowledging Olenna.
OLENNA,Your Grace I have travelled a long way.
CERSEI,You must be exhausted.
OLENNA,Put the pen down dear we all know you arent writing anything.
CERSEI,Ah yes the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns.
OLENNA,And the famous tart Queen Cersei.
CERSEI,Beg your pardon.
OLENNA,I know youre behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.
CERSEI,If you apologize for that comment perhaps--
OLENNA,Youll get your apology when I get Loras.
CERSEI,I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?
OLENNA,Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops gold and wheat my house supplies?
CERSEI,I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--
OLENNA,Do you expect the alliance to continue after youve thrown our future into prison?
CERSEI,As I said i didnt imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--
OLENNA,What veil?
CERSEI,The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
OLENNA,I didnt trust your father. I didnt particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.
CERSEI,House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit which Im sure they dont. Loras will be freed
HIGH SPARROW,You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?
LORAS,I dont pay attention to rumors.
SPARROW,You were said to be despondent when he died. Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside even as Stannis army closed in
LORAS,He was my friend. He was my king.
SPARROW,Wasnt Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7 not Renly.
LORAS,I was wrong to support Renlys claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.
SPARROW,Wearing Renlys armor.
LORAS,Why does it matter what I wore?
SPARROW,Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication buggery blasphemy.
LORAS,Of course I deny them.
SPARROW,You never lay with Renly Baratheon.
LORAS,Never.
SPARROW,Nor any other man.
LORAS,Never.
SPARROW,That will be all Ser Loras.Loras walks back to his seat.
OLENNA,Well I think thats quite enough of that.
SPARROW,Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.
MARGAERY,You call me forward?
SPARROW,Yes. We have some questions for you.
MARGAERY,I am the queen.
SPARROW,You are. And according to Law of the Seven neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest.Margaery walks to the stand.
SPARROW,How do you respond to these charges against your brother?
MARGAERY,They are lies.
SPARROW,All of them?
MARGAERY,All of them.
SPARROW,Queen Margaery in the presence of the gods do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him
MARGAERY,Yes I swear it.
SPARROW,Thank you your grace.The Faith brings Olyvar in. Loras looks shocked. Cersei gives a thin smile.
SPARROW,Do you know this man?
OLYVAR,Yes very well. He is Ser Loras Tyrell heir to Highgarden.
SPARROW,How did you come to meet?
OLYVAR,I squired for him. He took a liking to me. He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.
SPARROW,And what occurred in his chamber?
OLYVAR,We engaged in intimate relations.
SPARROW,You laid with him?
OLYVAR,That night and many others.
LORAS,Liar! Hes a liar!
SPARROW,Is there anyone else who can support your claim?
OLYVAR,Yes yes Queen Margaery. She walked in on us once not long ago. She didnt seem surprised.
CERSEI,This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?
OLYVAR,He has a birthmark your grace. Quite high on his thigh wine-colored
LORAS,Liar!
OLENNA,What are you doing? Let us pass.
SPARROW,The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras... and Queen Margaery.
MARGAERY,What?
SPARROW,Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any. Take her.The Faith grabs her and carries her out of the room.
MARGAERY,Tommen! Tommen!King Tommen looks around the room unsure of what to do.
MARGAERY,You cant do this I am the queen! Tommen Tommen! I am your queen
SANSA,What do you want?
MYRANDA,Lord Ramsay sent me to draw your bath my lady. You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband dont you?Cut to Sansa in the bath. Myranda washes the black dye out of Sansas hair.

SANSA,What others?
MYRANDA,Lets see. There was Kiera. The blacksmiths daughter. She was tall. Like you. Lovely figure. But she talked and talked and talked and<85> Ramsay got tired of that. Then there was Violet.

SANSA,Lord Tyrion was kind he was gentle he never touched me.
RAMSAY,Youre not lying to me?
SANSA,No my lord.
RAMSAY,Lying to your husband on his wedding night that would be a very bad way to start a marriage. We are man and wife now we should be honest with each other

OLENNA,You there! Where would I find the High Septon or High Sparrow or whatever bloody fool name hes got.
HIGH SPARROW,Its not as good a name as Queen of Thorns Ill admit.
OLENNA,You should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady.
SPARROW,You should have the decency to kneel before the gods
OLENNA,Dont spar with me little fellow.The High Septon gets up.
SPARROW,For me its the knees. You?
OLENNA,Hips.
SPARROW,Huh.
OLENNA,A man of the people is that your game? Its an old game. dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cerseis dirty work for her.
SPARROW,The people always do the dirty work.
OLENNA,Spare me the homilies I can smell a fraud from a mile away.
SPARROW,A useful talent.
OLENNA,Im here for my grandson and granddaughter.
SPARROW,Your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied. The Father judges us all. Sons of high lords sons of fishermen. If you break his laws you will be punished.The High Sparrow heads for the door.
OLENNA,Dont you walk away from me.
SPARROW,You dont give commands here Lady Olenna.
OLENNA,What is it you want? Gold? Ill make you the richest septon who ever lived.The High Sparrow laughs.
OLENNA,What then?
SPARROW,I imagine this is strange for you. Everyone you meet has a hidden motive and you pride yourself on slitting in and out. But Im telling you a simple truth: I serve the gods. The gods demand justice.
OLENNA,How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?
SPARROW,By the holy text. The seven pointed star. If you dont have one in your library Ill give you my own.
OLENNA,Ive read the seven pointed star.
SPARROW,Then youll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury. Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.
OLENNA,Half the men women and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers
SPARROW,Yes. The Gods laws must be applied to all equally.
OLENNA,If its equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital everyone here will starve. And Ill make sure the hungry know who to blame
SPARROW,Have you ever served the field Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye. You are the few. We are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few<85>He walks out of the room.EXT. SEPT OF BAELOR

CERSEI,This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. Its quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow but I fear The Faith has left reason behind.
MARGAERY,I know you did this.
CERSEI,We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.
MARGAERY,Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence decency concern? Youre not very good at those
CERSEI,Youre upset. Youre not thinking clearly. Ill visit again when youve had a chance to calm down.
MARGAERY,I dont want to see you again.
CERSEI,I do hope you change your mind about that. Ive been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins.

CERSEI,Who will stand judge?
SPARROW,Seven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens.
CERSEI,Will you be one of them?
SPARROW,I will.CERSEI: If one or both of them were to confess before the trial<85>
SPARROW,Then they will be at The Mothers mercy.
CERSEI,What does The Mothers mercy entail?
SPARROW,It depends on the situation. The acts themselves the degree of contrition.
CERSEI,Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.
SPARROW,Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in Kings Landing?
CERSEI,I think I may have heard at one point.

SPARROW,Who carved this altar do you know?
CERSEI,Im afraid i dont.
SPARROW,No one does. Theres no name on it. Or anywhere else in the chapel. The people who built this place didnt inflict their vanity on the people who came after them. The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there. Their faith was clean.
SPARROW,A young man came to us not long ago broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity

JORAH,Your Grace
DAENERYS,You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?
TYRION,If only I were otherwise.DAENERYS: If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldnt I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine
TYRION,You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
DAENERYS,So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
TYRION,Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. Its too soon to know if you deserve my service.
DAENERYS,If youd rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.
TYRION,When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth
DAENERYS,And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?
TYRION,Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.
DAENERYS,I have a very large army and very large dragons.
TYRION,Killing and politics arent always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.
DAENERYS,So you want to advise me. Very well.  What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.
TYRION,I know.
DAENERYS,Why should the people trust a queen who cant keep her promises?
TYRION,Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you
TYRION,Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?
DAENERYS,Yes
TYRION,And did he?
DAENERYS,No. Not until forced to do so.
TYRION,He worships you. He is in love with you
DAENERYS,So I should kill him?

ARYA,Left onto Ragman Lane
JAQEN,Lana is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God.
ARYA,How will she serve him?
JAQEN,She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.

MAN,Its my 18th voyage. Ive returned from all of them without a scratch on me.
THIN MAN,Cant do it.
MAN,Please I have 3 children. Without me-- here take it you have to
JAQEN,The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.
ARYA,So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?
JAQEN,A girl tells a man that she has seen.
ARYA,If the captain dies
JAQEN,But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesnt have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child
ARYA,The Many Faced God. You said you didnt know what I would see at the docks.
JAQEN,A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.
ARYA,And then what?
JAQEN,A gift for the Thin Man.He holds up a clear vile. Arya takes the vile

SANSA,Good. If it werent for you Id still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here
THEON,I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.

SANSA,Only what?
THEON,I cant..
SANSA,Tell me!

BOLTON BANNERMAN,Our scouts tells us hes got no more than 6000 men. More than half of them are mounted
ROOSE,And how high can Stannis horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze
ROOSE,You disagree?
RAMSAY,Stannis isnt from the North. You are
ROOSE,And what do you recommend?
RAMSAY,That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first
ROOSE,A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they cant touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldnt get an army through if we wanted to.RAMSAY: I dont need an army. I need 20 good men.INT. MEEREEN
DAENERYS,So have you decided yet? Whether Im worthy of your service?
TYRION,Have you decided yet whether youre going to have me killed?
DAENERYS,Its probably my safest option.
TYRION,I can see why you would think so. Its what your father would have done.
DAENERYS,And what would your father do?
TYRION,My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? Id say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
DAENERYS,Is that why you killed him?
TYRION,Some day if you decide not to execute me
DAENERYS,I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.
TYRION,So here we sit
DAENERYS,Im terrible?
TYRION,Ive heard stories.
DANERYS,Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?
TYRION,To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
DAENERYS,Which kind is that?
TYRION,The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
DAENERYS,I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.
TYRION,Yes
TYRION,Its not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
DAENERYS,Varys? King Roberts spy master?
TYRION,Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
DAENERYS,Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.
TYRION,He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didnt have to do. I suspect hes the main reason you werent slaughtered in your crib.DAENERYS: But you trust him?
TYRION,Yes
DAENERYS,The brother who killed my father.
TYRION,Thats the one.
DAENERYS,Perhaps I will have you killed after all.
TYRION,Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well
DAENERYS,Im not going to kill you.
TYRION,No? Banish me?
DAENERYS,No.
TYRION,So if Im not going to be murdered
DAENERYS,Youre going to advise me.  While you can still speak in complete sentences.
TYRION,Advise you on what?
DAENERYS,How to get what I want.
TYRION,The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.
DAENERYS,If I want jokes Ill get myself a proper fool.
TYRION,Im not entirely joking. Theres more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.
DAENERYS,I fought so that no child born into Slavers Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.
TYRION,And when you get back to your home
DAENERYS,The common people.
TYRION,Lets be generous and assume thats going to happen. Here in Slavers Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like
DAENERYS,Lannister

KARSI,Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them
JON,Its not a trick. Its a gift for those who join us.Karsi examine the glass in shock.
JON,Dragonglass. A man of the Nights Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.
LOBODA,You saw this?
JON,No. But I trust the man.
KARSI,There are old stories about Dragonglass.
LOBODA,There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds.
KARSI,And with the things weve seen you dont believe them?
JON,Come with me and I'll share these weapons.
KARSI,Come with you where?
JON,There are good lands south of the wall.  The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.There is hesitation.
JON,I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Nights Watch
KARSI,If<85>?
JON,If you swear you join us when the real war begins.
LOBODA,Where is Mance?
JON,He died.
LOBODA,How?
JON,I put an arrow through his heart.The wildlings in the cabin start to riot.
LOBODA,I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.Loboda brandishes his axe. Tormund steps forward.
TORMUND,None of you saw Mance die! I did. The Southern King who broke our army
KARSI,I lost my father
JON,Im not asking you to forget your dead. Ill never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But Im asking you to think about your children now. Theyll never have children of their own if we dont band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk cant stop them. The Nights Watch cant stop them. And all the southern kings cant stop them. Only together
KARSI,You vouch for this man
TORMUND,Hes prettier than both my daughters
LOBODA,My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.
KARSI,So would mine
TORMUND,This is the way.
WILDLING ELDER,Im with Tormund. We stay here were dead men. At least with King Crow theres a chance.
GIANT,Tormund.
LOBODA,Keep that new life you want to give us. Keep your glass
KARSI,I fucking hate Thenns.Tormund nods.EXT. HARDHOME - SHOREJon
JON,How many are with us? 5000?
TORMUND,Im not good at counting.
JON,Were leaving too many behind.
TORMUND,The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.
JON,And he knew them better than I ever will.
TORMUND,Theyre running out of food and theres nothing to hunt. Theyll come around.Cut to Karsi loading two children onto a boat.
KARSI,Johnna is gonna look after you. Shes in charge
DAUGHTER,I wanna go with you.
KARSI,I need to get the old folks on the boats. Im right behind you
LOBODA,Shut the gate.Men hurry towards the gate to board it up. More howling from the distance. The Wildlings on the other side of the gate begin charging the gate.
LOBODA,Shut the gate!!Men rush to put a board in place to hold the gate shut.
SHOUTING,Wait! Open the gate! Let us in! Help us! Please open it!Loboda walks to the gate with his axe and peers through a small hole in the wall. There is a faint scream in the distance
LOBODA,Ready your arrows!The wights claw at the gate. Arrows are nocked and fired. A wight sticks his hand through the gate and Loboda chops it off.EXT. HARDHOME - SHOREThere is a mad rush towards the boats with many people jumping in the water to catch one.
JON,Get in line! Get in line!EXT. HARDHOME - GATEA wight tries to climb the gate.INT. HARDHOME - CABINWights crawl to the top of the cabin and jumps through the hole in the roof. The men prepare their weapons and the giant growls.EXT. HARDHOME - GATEOne wight tries to climb under the gate. A barrage of arrows flies at the wights trying to get through the wall. Most of them land. The wight crawls even further under the gate. The wights start making holes in the gate. A sword sticks through the gate coming close to Loboda on the gate. Loboda dodges the sword
JON,Hold the line! Hold the line!
NIGHTS WATCH BROTHER,Lord Commander!
JON,Get them to the ship and come back for me!
BROTHER,But youll never make it--
JON,Now!Karsi approaches Jon.
JON,You should be on one of those boats.
KARSI,So should you ! My little girl has gone on. They're gonna let them pass the wall even if youre not there ?
JON,You have my word. Ive given orders.
KARSI,Dont think youre gonna be there to enforce those orders !Karsi heads back to helping people onto the boats.
TORMUND,If they get through
JON,Nights Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!Jon
JON,The Dragonglass!
LOBODA,Youre with me
LOBODA,Get the glass.Loboda walks towards the White Walker as Jon scrambles towards the Dragonglass. Loboda misses with his axe twice
JON,The Dragonglass!
EDD,Fuck the glass! Were gonna die here.A screech comes from the top of the cliff. Hundreds of wights dive from the top of the cliff. They appear to have died for a brief moment after landing
JON,Go! Go! Go!
TORMUND,Wun Wun
JON,Lets go now! Now!Jon looks back to shore to see the Wights
DAVOS,A band of 20 men maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them
STANNIS,Horses?
DAVOS,Were still getting a count but hundreds are dead.
STANNIS,20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?
DAVOS,The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.
STANNIS,Put last nights guards in chains either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them.
DAVOS,Unless theres a thaw we cant press forward to Winterfell

ALLISER,You have a good heart Jon Snow. It will get us all killed.INT. STANNIS TENTStannis is studying his chessboard. There are 2 Baratheon pieces next to a sword and opposed to 2 Bolton pieces. Davos enters the tent.
DAVOS,You sent for me Your Grace.
STANNIS,Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you Im sending you back to Castle Black. Tell the Lord Commander to send food
DAVOS,Your Grace youve named me your Hand.
STANNIS,Yes.
DAVOS,The Kings Hand should never abandon the King especially in a time of war.
STANNIS,Youre not abandoning me youre obeying a command.
DAVOS,A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.
STANNIS,And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll what does the boy say? I didnt name you hand for your expertise in military matters
DAVOS,Your Grace perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me.
STANNIS,My family stays with me.
DAVOS,At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.

DAVOS,Well that sounds like a proper story.SHIREEN: Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar. He polished his shield for a week til the steel was like a mirror. Then he crouched behind it
DAVOS,But the dragon only saw a dumb man holding a mirrored shield.
SHIREEN,And burnt him to a crisp.Davos and Shireen share a laugh.
DAVOS,Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something Princess.Davos hands her a stag carved out of wood.
DAVOS,Do you like it?
SHIREEN,Hes beautiful.Shireen kisses him on the cheek.
SHIREEN,Thank you.
DAVOS,Youre very welcome.
SHIREEN,Will you make me a doe too
DAVOS,Of course I will.
SHIREEN,But why am I getting a present?
DAVOS,Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading
SHIREEN,Youll just have to read it yourself.Davos kisses Shireen on her forehead then leaves. Shireen looks over the stag.INT. DORNE - PALACEJaime is escorted by Areo to Dorans room.

JAIME,What a lovely dress.
MYRCELLA,You dont like it?JAIME: You must be cold.
MYRCELLA,Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.
JAIME,Prince Trystane. Hows your jaw?
TRYSTANE,A fleabite.
ELLARIA,What are you doing in Dorne?
JAIME,Looking out for the safety of my niece the princess Myrcella.
DORAN,And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force.
JAIME,We received a threatening message. The princesss necklace in the jaws of a viper.Jaime looks at Ellaria.
MYRCELLA,That necklace was stolen from my room.Doran looks at Ellaria. A servant sets down food and drink before Jaime.
JAIME,Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.
DORAN,We cant behead you. Many in Dorne want war. But Ive seen war. Ive seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. Ive seen the orphans starving in the cities. I dont want to lead my people into that hell.
ELLARIA,No you want to break bread with the Lannisters.
DORAN,And that is precisely what we are doing.  Let us drink to Tommen the first of his name
DORAN,King Tommen insists on his sisters return to the capital?
JAIME,Im afraid he does.
DORAN,I cannot disobey my Kings command.  She will return with you to Kings Landing. And my son Prince Trystane
JAIME,I accept.
DORAN,One more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death. Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the loop. With Oberyn gone Trystane will take his place on the small council.JAIME: You have my word.
ELLARIA,The word of a Kingslayer.Ellaria gets up and walks to Doran.
ELLARIA,No wonder you cant stand. You have no spine.Ellaria tries to leave the room. Doran grabs her wrist.
DORAN,You are mother to four of my nieces girls I love very much. For their sake
JAIME,May I inquire into the fate of my man?
DORAN,Tell me Ser Jaime
JAIME,He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished its me.
DORAN,Prince Trystane must learn judgement if hes to rule one day. Ill let him decide.Jaime looks to Trystane. Trystane considers.
TRYSTANE,I have learned the value of mercy from my father. I will set your man free.
JAIME,Youre a good man.
TRYSTANE,On one condition.INT. DORNE - CELLBronn is laying on the ground in his cell. Tyene and Nymeria are playing a game where one tries to slap the others hand before they pull their hands away. Nymeria slaps Tyene.

TYENE,Youre going to miss.
NYMERIA,I never miss.TYENE: You will. Youre thinking too much. Now youre nervous. <93>What if shes right?<94>Nymeria slaps at Tyene and Tyene gets out of the way in time.
NYMERIA,Luck.
TYENE,Now its my turn.
NYMERIA,Youre too slow. Youve always been too slow.Nymeria sticks her hands out and blows a kiss to Tyene. Tyene slaps her across the face then blows one back. They get in fighting stances as the guards arrive. They take Bronn out of his cell.
BRONN,Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk?
AREO,Youll find out very soon.Bronn starts leaving the prison.
TYENE,Say it one more time handsome. Who am I?BRONN: The most beautiful woman in the world.
TYENE,And thats the truth!
NYMERIA,Slut.Tyene laughs.INT. DORNE - PALACEAreo escorts Bronn into Dorans room.

BRONN,Only the one.
JAIME,I believe youve already met Prince Trystane.
BRONN,Prince. Sorry about the other day.
JAIME,Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. Hes agreed to grant you your freedom.
BRONN,Im glad to hear it. The pie looks good.
JAIME,There was one condition.Jaime nods to Areo. Areo elbows Bronn in the jaw knocking him to the ground.

BANKER,Lord Tyrell! On behalf of the Iron Bank may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos. I hope your journey was trouble free.
MACE,Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor.
BANKER,And how goes the harvest in the Reach?
MACE,Vintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement Ill be sure to send the Arbors finest your way.
BANKER,Im afraid I dont partake.Arya studies the group focuses in on Meryn
MACE,Some consider usury distasteful dishonorable. Pure nonsense
BANKER,I'm glad we see eye-to-eye on this matter.
MACE,Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.Meryn and Arya exchange quick looks at each other.
BANKER,Most unfortunate for the glovers.
MACE,If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble.
BANKER,We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank Lord Tyrell.
MACE,You are the world's best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this.Mace gestures to the Iron Bank and the camera cuts to it.EXT. IRON BANK - LATERArya is waiting on the steps of the building opposite the bank eating her oysters. The men start walking out of the Bank.
BANKER,Im afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.
MACE,Oh nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?
BANKER,I don't have that gift.
MACE,It's not a gift its a skill
MERYN,I thought that old shit would never stop singing.
MAN,It wasnt bad though.
MERYN,The Tyrells can all rot in hell treasonous cunts. They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king.They arrive at a door.
MERYN,This is the place lads. The sleekest little minks in Braavos.
MAN,Youre buying?
MERYN,Oh Im buying. But I never was good at sharing.They enter the brothel. Arya pulls up to the doorway with her cart and sees the men entering.INT. BROTHELArya walks through the door with a tray of oysters. The brothel keeper stops her.

PROSTITUTE,They say oysters get the juices flowing. Well take half a dozen.
ARYA,Three coppers.Arya begins cutting an oyster open.
JOHN,Heres a silver because the lady likes you.The man places a silver on her tray in exchange for the oysters. Arya turns and sees Trants men being taken to a back room.INT. BROTHEL - BACK ROOMArya enters the room and peers through a divider to see a prostitute posing for Meryn.
MERYN,Too old.
HEAD PROSTITUTE,Brea.Brea poses for Meryn.
MERYN,Too old.

MERYN,Too old.The people in the room share uneasy glances as they realize what hes asking for.
MERYN,Do you have what I want or not?
HEAD,Of course. Of course.One of Trants men crosses to the other side of the divider and confronts Arya.
MAN,Fresh? Come on the lads are hungry.The man drags her into the room.
MAN,Nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters.
MAN 2,Ill have one.Meryn stares at Arya.
HEAD,Who let this girl in? Shoo shoo!The head prostitute brings in a child.
MERYN,Good.The head prostitute hands Meryn an hourglass. He hands it back.
MERYN,Ill tell you when were done.He leads the girl towards a bedroom.
MERYN,Youll have a fresh one for me tomorrow.
HEAD,Of course.The head prostitute realizes Arya is still standing there.
HEAD,Ill have you whipped girl! Go on!Arya leaves the room

ARYA,The Thin Man wasnt hungry today.
JAQEN,Perhaps thats why the man is thin.The man drops to the ground creating a thud off-screen.
ARYA,Tomorrow.

ELLARIA,You write like a 7 year old.
JAIME,Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.
ELLARIA,He didnt try to make you pay?
ELLARIA,Then maybe hes changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know youll be bringing her daughter home
JAIME,She will.
ELLARIA,You love her very much dont you?
JAIME,Of course shes my niece.
ELLARIA,I wasnt talking about her.Jaime looks up from his writing at Ellaria.
ELLARIA,You think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago
ELLARIA,I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that.Ellaria exits the room.INT. SHIREENS TENTShireen plays with her stag figurine next to a fire and on top of her book. Stannis enters the tent.SHIREEN: Father. Arent you cold?
STANNIS,No. What are you reading?
SHIREEN,The Dance of Dragons.
STANNIS,Whats it about?
SHIREEN,Its the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over
STANNIS,<93>The dance of dragons<94>? Why is that a dance?
SHIREEN,Thats just what they call it.
STANNIS,Doesnt make much sense.
SHIREEN,I think its poetic.
STANNIS,If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon who would you have chosen?
SHIREEN,I wouldnt have chosen either. Its all the choosing sides that made things so horrible.
STANNIS,Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it.
SHIREEN,Its alright father.
STANNIS,You dont even know what Im talking about.
SHIREEN,It doesnt matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help?

SHIREEN,Wheres my father? No you cant do this father where are you?!Stannis watches on from the crowd.
SHIREEN,Let me see my father! Where are you please?!
SELYSE,Its what the Lord wants. Its a good thing. A great thing.
MELISANDRE,The year is now my Lord. For you we offer up this girl
SELYSE,If we dont act then well all starve here all of us but if we make this sacrifice<85>
MELISANDRE,Accept this token of our faith my lord and lead us from the darkness. Lord of Light show us the way!SHIREEN: Mother
SELYSE,I cant.

DAENERYS,Where have you been?
HIZDAHR,Just making sure everythings in order.Camera pans through the fighting pit to reveal it is covered with House Targaryen sigils. An announcer steps to the middle of the pit and waves his arm to silence the crowd.
ANNOUNCER,Free citizens of Meereen! By the blessings of the Graces and her majesty the Queen welcome to the Great Games!The Announcer raises his hands and the crowd begins to roar. Cut to Daenerys box - she and Missandei look disgusted

HIZDAHR,Theyre waiting for you. Clap your hands.Daenerys looks down at the two men. After a moment and with a look of disgust on her face
DAARIO,That one the smaller man
DAENERYS,Im not putting my money anywhere.
HIZDAHR,Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does.
DAARIO,People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits.  He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.
HIZDAHR,I have spent much of my life in Meereen and in my experience
DAENERYS,Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You yourself
DAARIO,Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one the crowd saw me
HIZDAHR,You dont approve?
TYRION,Theres always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.HIZDAHR: Fair enough yet -- its an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?
TYRION,Its easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.
HIZDAHR,Im not talking about myself. Im talking about the necessary conditions of greatness.Cut to pit workers carrying the decapitated head out of the pit leaving a trail of blood behind.
DAENERYS,That is greatness?
HIZDAHR,That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.TYRION: My father would have liked you.
ANNOUNCER,We ask again: who will triumph?
DAENERYS,One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.
HIZDAHR,At your command?
DAENERYS,If need be.
ANNOUNCER,A Meereenese champion?The crowd applauds.
HIZDAHR,How many people will die to make this happen?
DAENERYS,If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.
HIZDAHR,Those men think theyre dying for a good reason.
DAENERYS,Someone elses reason.
HIZDAHR,So your reasons are true and theirs are false. They dont know their own minds
TYRION,Well said youre an eloquent man. Doesnt mean youre wrong. In my experience
ANNOUNCER,...or a Westerosi Knight?!Crowd jeers.
JORAH,I fight and die for your glory oh glorious Queen.Daenerys stares at Jorah. They both hold back emotion.
HIZDAHR,Your Grace--
DAARIO,Shut your mouth.Daenerys claps. Jorah nods. They begin fighting with Daenerys eyes following Jorah. He takes a blow to the mouth
Jorahs opponent slices Jorahs arm then knocks him over knocking his sword out of his hand. He holds his blade to Jorahs throat. Both he and Jorah look to Daenerys.TYRION,You can end this.
HIZDAHR,She cannot.
TYRION,You can!The fighter holds his blade to Jorahs throat. He is about to make a move when the other fighter comes over and stabs Jorahs opponent in the back killing him. Jorah gets up and faces the final opponent. Jorah matches the spearman
DAARIO,Protect your queen!The Sons of the Harpy start slitting the throats of former slaves and Unsullied in the crowd. Unsullied guards and Daario surround Daenerys and Missandei fighting off the Harpys. Hizdahr starts running towards Daenerys.
HIZDAHR,Your Grace Your Grace
TYRION,Stay close!Sons of the Harpy have began to rush the pit. Unsullied fight them off as Daenerys Daario

TYRION,Dwarf. I believe thats the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit <93>nostril<94>.
MISSANDEI,A bit <93>rusty<94>.
TYRION,<93>Rusty<94>  Thank you.
GREY WORM,I am sorry. Sorry I am not there to fight for my queen.
DAARIO,You missed a good scrap.
JORAH,None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.
TYRION,Hes right. The dragon headed north. If were going to find her thats where were to go.
JORAH,We? Youre a Lannister. The Queen intends to remove your family from power.
TYRION,And I intend to help her do it.
JORAH,Youve been here for how many days now? Ive fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.
TYRION,You betrayed her!
JORAH,Careful now.
TYRION,And she exiled you twice
JORAH,The second time thanks to you.
TYRION,Dont blame me for your crimes Mormont.
DAARIO,And hes right Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way well know is if we ask her.
TYRION,Fine fine
JORAH,If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open.
DAARIO,Forgive me but why would we bring you?
TYRION,Pardon me?
DAARIO,Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?
TYRION,Not precisely but I have other skills thatd be very useful--
DAARIO,Can you fight?
TYRION,I have fought. I dont claim to be a great warrior.
DAARIO,Are you good on a horse?
TYRION,Middling.
DAARIO,So mainly you talk?
TYRION,And drink. Ive survived so far.
DAARIO,Which I respect. But you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen though. (to Missandei
JORAH,Hes a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?
DAARIO,They wouldnt. They will listen to Grey Worm.
GREY WORM,Ill come with you. Ill find our queen.
MISSANDEI,You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
GREY WORM,I am.
DAARIO,He is hes the toughest man with no balls Ive ever met. But you still cant go. The people believe in you. They know you speak for the queen.
MISSANDEI,Its true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave half the city will consume the other half.
DAARIO,And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queens closest confidant the commander of the Unsullied
VOICE,Hello old friend.Tyrion turns to see Varys on the balcony next to him.
VARYS,I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.
TYRION,I suppose theres no point in asking how you found me.
VARYS,The birds sing in the west the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me youve already found favor with the Mother of Dragons.
TYRION,Well she didnt execute me
VARYS,Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.
TYRION,If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.
VARYS,If only.  A grand old city choking on violence
TYRION,I did miss you.
VARYS,Oh I know.EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - PLATEAUDany looks to Drogon who is lying down in a ring full of bones.

CERSEI,No.
SPARROW,No others?
CERSEI,No.
SPARROW,Speaking falsehoods before the Gods is a great crime. You understand this?
CERSEI,I do.
SPARROW,There are those who say your children were not fathered by King Robert. That they are bastards born of incest and adultery.
CERSEI,A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne but his brothers children stand in his way
SPARROW,Good. But these are terrible charges. And the realm must know the truth of them. If Your Grace has given honest testimony your trial will prove your innocence.
CERSEI,Trial? I have confessed?
SPARROW,To a single sin. Others you have denied. Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.
CERSEI,I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mothers mercy. I havent seen my son<85> I dont know how long its been. I need to see him. Please.
SPARROW,You have taken the first step on a path back to righteousness. In light of this I will permit you to return to the Red Keep.

DAVOS,Hell have seen we didnt come. Thorne will have made it official by now. Castle Black is his.

ROOSE,I rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark. Do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired outnumbered Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?
RAMSAY,No.ROOSE walks past RAMSAY into Winterfells great hall.
ROOSE,A reckoning will come. We need the North to face it. The entire North. They wont back us without Sansa Stark. We no longer have Sansa Stark. You played your games with her. You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands and now theyre both gone.
RAMSAY,I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds. They wont get far.

BOLTON OFFICER,Its a bloody woman.BRIENNE cuts down BOLTON OFFICER as she rides past. PODRICK engages one of the soldiers in mounted combat. BRIENNE faces off with another mounted soldier. Their blades clash but neither is hit. As BRIENNE rides past him another soldier knocks her from her horse. She drops her blade but scrambles to retrieve it when she sees a soldier advancing towards her on foot. When she reaches the blade the soldier kicks her. She retrieves the blade again and stands
BRIENNE,Lady Sansa I offer my services once again. I will shield your back and keep your council and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new.SANSA turns at looks at THEON for confirmation. THEON nods his head.
SANSA,And I vow...that you shall always have a place by my hearth and<85>
PODRICK,Meat and mead at my table.

CERSEI,All I could think about when she died was what would happen to her now. Every day every night what does Mama look like now? Has she started to bloat? Has her skin turned black? Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?CERSEI begins to tear up.
CERSEI,I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt.JAIME walks over to CERSEI and kneels in front of her.
CERSEI,I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse.
JAIME,Shh shh. Dont think about it.
CERSEI,I have to. I have to. Its not right she has to suffer alone.
JAIME,Shes not suffering. Shes gone. No one can hurt her anymore.
CERSEI,She was good. From her first breath she was so sweet. I dont know where she came from. She was nothing like me. No meanness no jealous just good.
JAIME,I know.
CERSEI,I thought if I could make something so good so pure...maybe Im not a monster.
JAIME,Listen -- listen to me. She was my daughter and I failed her.
CERSEI,No I knew this would happen. The witch told me years ago. She promised me three children. She promised me theyd die. <93>And gold their shrouds.<94> Everything she said came true. You couldnt have stopped it. Its prophecy. Its fate.
JAIME,You dont believe that.
CERSEI,Of course I do. You told me yourself when Father died. You said we had to stay together. You said people would try to tear us apart take whats ours. That was a prophecy too. I didnt listen to you and everything you said came true.JAIME places his hand on CERSEIs cheek..

HIGH SPARROW,It isnt Ser Loras that brings me here. Your husband misses you dearly. The love between a man and wife is sacred. It reflects the love the gods have for all of us. But sin leads us away from the sacred. And only confession can purge sin.
MARGAERY,I have nothing to confess.
HIGH SPARROW,So you believe you are pure? Perfect? Wholly without sin?
MARGAERY,None of us are.
HIGH SPARROW,You have started down the path. But you have many miles to go..HIGH SPARROW exits. MARGAERY hugs her knees.
DORAN,I always envied Oberyn. He lived. He truly lived. Sailed around the world. Fought men from every country. Lay with the most beautiful women alive.
ELLARIA,And men.
DORAN,And men. He experienced everything while I sat here in Dorne trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed. But that is life. We each have our roles.DORAN sits in his wheelchair. ELLARIA places a pillow behind him.
DORAN,Oberyn was born to be an adventurer. And I was born to rule.
ELLARIA,The gods are not fools. You would have been a lousy adventurer. And Oberyn pfft he would have been a terrible ruler.A maester approaches.
DORAN,Your mother is a brilliant woman you know that?
MAESTER,Prince Doran.The maester bows and hands DORAN a scroll. DORAN unravels and reads it.
DORAN,The Princess Myrcella<85>TYENE produces  a dagger from her boot and stabs AREO in the back killing him. ELLARIA produces a dagger of her own and stabs DORAN in the chest. The maester tries to run away but TYENE retrieves her dagger from AREOs body and throws it into the back of the maesters neck killing him. ELLARIA removes her dagger from DORANs chest and pushes him to the ground. The remaining guards do nothing.
ELLARIA,When was the last time you left this palace? You dont know your own people. Their disgust for you. Elia Martell raped and murdered and you did nothing. Oberyn martell butchered and you did nothing. Youre not a Dornishman. Youre not our prince.DORAN is bleeding out on the ground. He gasps for air.
DORAN,My son Trystane<85>ELLARIA scoffs.
ELLARIA,Your son is weak just like you. And weak men will never rule Dorne again.DORAN dies.CUT TO: SUNSPEAR - TRYSTANES CHAMBERTRYSTANE is painting an eye on a stone. OBARA and NYMERIA enter. TRYSTANE does not look at them.

OBARA,Were here to kill you.OBARA walks to the opposite side of the room. NYMERIA remains by the door. TRYSTANE reaches for his sword.
NYMERIA,You want her to do it or me?
TRYSTANE,We are family. I dont want to hurt you.
NYMERIA,Her or me?TRYSTANE draws his blade and points it at NYMERIA.
NYMERIA,Good.
OBARA,Smart boy.TRYSTANE steps between the two women readying himself to fight NYMERIA. OBARA stabs him through the back of his head with her spear.NYMERIA: Youre a greedy bitch you know that?OBARA and NYMERIA exit.
TYRION,Were never going to fix whats wrong with this city from the top of an 800-foot pyramid.VARYS looks over his shoulder at a passing commoner.
TYRION,Well be fine. Were dressed like common merchants.
VARYS,You walk like a rich person.
TYRION,Youve spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?
VARYS,You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property. I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy.
TYRION,Its a good thing youre not a boy anymore...because you have no cock.A woman is lying in the street holding a baby. TYRION and VARYS approach.
TYRION,For your baby. To eat.The woman cowers away from TYRION.
VARYS,She thinks you want to eat her baby.VARYS kneels.
VARYS,His Valyrian is terrible. He only wants to give you money so your baby can eat.VARYS hands the woman money. She gestures at them to thank them and they walk on. They walk into a courtyard where <93>KILL THE MASTERS<94> is written in red on a wall. Beneath it <93>MHYSA IS A MASTER
VARYS,Mhysa means mother in Valyrian.
TYRION,I know what mhysa means.
VARYS,Who wrote it?
TYRION,Hard to know. Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be.
VARYS,The Sons of the Harpy?
TYRION,Very possibly. Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property told them human beings werent even property to begin with. You can see why theyre unhappy. Of course it could also be the freed men.TYRION and VARYS enter a chamber where a red priest is preaching to a group of listeners.
LISTENERS,For the night is dark and full of terrors.
RED PRIEST,The Lord of Light sent the Mother of Dragons to you and those who love the darkness chased her away.
TYRION,Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them.
VARYS,She did fly away on a dragon and not come back.
RED PRIEST,How will you respond? Will you wring your hands while you wait for the Mother of Dragons to return? Or will you  you take up her flames yourselves? Will you fight for your own salvation now that Queen Daenerys is not here to fight for you?
TYRION,Its a problem.TYRION and VARYS proceed in a much larger courtyard.
TYRION,Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill. Whoever you are wherever you go someone in this city wants to murder you. We cant fight an enemy we dont know.
VARYS,The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully which means they take orders from someone.
TYRION,And have you started looking for that someone?
VARYS,My little birds have already taken wing. Soon theyll return singing songs of men in gold masks.Men are shouting in the distance. A bell begins to toll. A flood of people run through an archway on the opposite side of the courtyard toward TYRION and VARYS then run past them. TYRION and VARYS proceed through the archway and into the harbor. Smoke pours from the burning wreckage of all the ships in the harbor.
TYRION,Well we wont be sailing to Westeros anytime soon.

JORAH,Ram.
DAARIO,You think our friend got him?
JORAH,Dont know anything else that can melt a rams horn.
DAARIO,Were on the right path then.JORAH and DAARIO return to their horses. They proceed across the countryside.
DAARIO,Perhaps shes tired of being queen. I dont think she likes it very much.
JORAH,Shes too smart to like it.
DAARIO,Maybe shes flown somewhere else somewhere far away from men like us.
JORAH,Ive been all over the world. Theres no escaping men like us.
DAARIO,Theres no escaping her eh? You keep coming back. Why?
JORAH,You know why.
DAARIO,isnt it frustrating wanting someone who doesnt want you back?
JORAH,Of course it is.
DAARIO,Youre a romantic. I admire that. Sometimes I look at you and I think <93>So thats what Ill be like when I grow old.<94>
JORAH,If you grow old.
DAARIO,If I grow old. I hope I do. I want to see what the world looks like when shes done conquering it.
JORAH,So do I.JORAH stops his horse. DAARIO proceeds ahead. JORAH pulls back his sleeve and looks at the growing patch of Greyscale on his forearm. The men resume riding in unison. They pull up on a circular swathe of horse tracks. There is a smaller circle of untouched grass in the center of the swathe.
DAARIO,Huh an army?
JORAH,Not an army. A horde.JORAH dismounts his horse and walks to the circle of untouched grass.
DAARIO,Dothraki?JORAH looks down and sees something in the grass. He bends down and retrieves a ring.
JORAH,They have her.
BLOODRIDER #1,Maybe she saw a ghost. My friends mother saw a ghost and her hair turned white.

LORD KARSTARK,He came upon the bodies on our way here.
ROOSE,Half a dozen men? Your best hunters?
RAMSAY,They obviously had help.
ROOSE,I didnt think lady Sansa killed them all by herself. Thank you for this report Lord Kastark.
RAMSAY,We know where shes going. Her brothers at Castle Black.
LORD KARSTARK,Ned Starks last surviving son?
ROOSE,Jon Snow is a bastard not a Stark.
RAMSAY,So was I Father.
LORD KARSTARK,Your hold on the North will never be secure as long as a Stark can walk through that door.
RAMSAY,Castle Black isnt defended on the southern side. And the few men left are barely men at all. Farm boys and thieves. With a small force we could storm the castle kill Jon Snow --
ROOSE,Murder the Lord Commander of the Nights Watch? Youd unite every house in the North against us.
RAMSAY,We dont need every house in the North. The Umbers the Manderlys and the Karstarks. command more soldiers than all the other houses combined. With their support none could challenge us.
LORD KARSTARK,The Starks lost my house the day King Rob cut off my fathers head. Its time for new blood in the North.ROOSE looks at both his son and lord Karstark. He gets up and stands in front of them.

She didnt want to leave him he didnt want to leave her.
SANSA,You dont know which way she went?
BRIENNE,I spent three days looking for her. She disappeared.
SANSA,How did she look?
BRIENNE,She looked good. She wasnt exactly dressed like a lady.SANSA smiles.
SANSA,No she wouldnt be.
BRIENNE,What happened at Winterfell?SANSA pauses and tears up.
SANSA,I shouldve gone with you while I had the chance.
BRIENNE,It was a difficult choice my lady.BRIENNE looks at THEON.
BRIENNE,Weve all had to make difficult choices.THEON stands up and walks away from PODRICK. SANSA stands and walks to THEON.

SANSA,I wont let him. Ill tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon.
THEON,And the truth about the farm boys I killed in their place? The truth about Ser Rodrik who I beheaded?SANSA looks to the ground.
THEON,And the truth about Rob who I betrayed?
SANSA,When you take the black all your crimes are forgiven.
THEON,I dont want to be forgiven. I can never make amends to your family for all the things that Ive done. Theyll keep you safer than I ever could.

YARA,The Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte.
BALON,And the Ironborn who held it?
YARA,They died fighting to a man.
BALON,What is dead may never die.
YARA,What is dead may never die.YARA places the piece of paper she was reading from on a table.
YARA,But they did and our invasion died with them. Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland.
BALON,They we will take more.
YARA,Why? For more pinecones and rocks?BALON turns around to face YARA.
BALON,Because I order it.
YARA,We can defeat anyone at sea but well never hold lands and castles against mainland armies.BALON walks to YARA.
BALON,Not if our captains defy my orders abandon their posts and sacrifice our men on foolish mission.
YARA,I wont apologize for trying to rescue Theon.
BALON,Then where is he?
YARA,Where is your kingdom? We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war. That war is over. The last time we provoked them too far I watched from that window as they breached our walls and knocked down our towers. I lost two brothers that day.
BALON,And I lost three sons. The War of the Five Kings they call it. Well the other four are dead. When you rule the Iron Islands you can wage all the peace you wan. But for now
BALON,Let me pass. You fool move aside for your king.
HOODED FIGURE,Havent I always brother?The hooded figure takes off his hood revealing his identity. He is EURON GREYJOY. BALON walks a few steps closer.
BALON,I thought youd be rotting under some foreign sea by now.
EURON,What is dead may never die.BALON does not respond.
EURON,Has the custom changed since Ive been gone? Arent you supposed to repeat the words?
BALON,You can mock our god without my help.
EURON,I dont mock the Drowned God. I am the Drowned God. From Oldtown to Qarth when men see my sails they pray.The wind buffets the bridge back and forth. BALON tries to hold his balance. EURON chuckles.
EURON,Youre old brother. You've had your time. Now let another rule.BALON walks towards his brother.
BALON,I heard you lost your mind during the storm on the Jade Sea. They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard.
EURON,They did.
BALON,And when the storm passed you cut out their tongues.
EURON,I needed silence.
BALON,What kind of an Ironborn loses his senses during a storm?EURON: I am the storm brother. The first storm and the last. And youre in my way.BALON draws a knife and slashes EURON across the face. EURON throws BALON off the bridge. BALON falls to his death.CUT TO: PYKE ISLAND BEACH - DAYMany Ironborn are in attendance for BALON's funeral. AERON GREYJOY and several Drowned Men are gathered around BALON's body. They are performing funeral rites covering it with rocks seaweed
AERON,Lord take your servant Balon back beneath the waves. Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh. Pull his bones down to your depths to rest beside his ancestors and his children.
ALL,What is dead may never die.
YARA,Im going to find out who did this. Im going to feed them to the sharks while they live. I swear it by the Salt Throne.
AERON,The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.
YARA,My father wouldve wanted me to rule.
AERON,Your father does not get to choose. The law is clear. Perhaps you'll win. Perhaps youll be the first woman in history to rule the Ironborn. And perhaps not.
MELISANDRE,Come in.DAVOS enters.
DAVOS,I'm sorry my lady. I didnt mean to interrupt.
MELISANDRE,You interrupt nothing.DAVOS looks at the fireplace and then at MELISANDRE.

MELISANDRE,The former Lord Commander.
DAVOS,Does he have to be?MELISANDRE looks at DAVOS.
MELISANDRE,What are you asking?
DAVOS,Do you know of any magic...that could help him? Bring him back?
MELISANDRE,If you want to help him leave him be.
DAVOS,Can it be done?
MELISANDRE,There are some with his power.
DAVOS,How?
MELISANDRE,I dont know.
DAVOS,Have you seen it done?MELISANDRE: I met a man who came back from the dead but the priest who did it -- It shouldnt have been possible.
DAVOS,But it was. It could be now.
MELISANDRE,Not for me.MELISANDRE stands and walks away from her chair. DAVOS walks towards her.
DAVOS,Not for you? I saw you drink poison that shouldve killed you. I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows.
MELISANDRE,Everything I believed the great victory I saw in the flames all of it was a lie.MELISANDRE looks at DAVOS.
MELISANDRE,You were right all along. The Lord never spoke to me.
DAVOS,Fuck him then. Fuck all of them. Im not a devout man obviously. Seven Gods drowned gods
DAVOS,Im not asking the Lord of Light for help.Im asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist.
MELISANDRE,I never had this gift.
DAVOS,Have you ever tried?CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - ROOMDAVOS TORMUND DOLOROUS EDD and MELISANDRE are gathered around JON SNOW's body. GHOST is sleeping on the floor. MELISANDRE is performing a ritual on JON SNOW's body. She wrings out a wet cloth with which she cleans out the wounds of JON SNOW. She cuts his hair and beard and throws the hairs in a firepit. Then she places her hands on JON SNOW's chest and utters an incantation in Valyrian. She sighs.
MELISANDRE,Please.MELISANDRE lets her hands down slowly. She has tears in her eyes and looks to DAVOS. TORMUND scoffs and exits followed by MELISANDRE and DOLOROUS EDD. DAVOS lingers and stares at JON SNOW's body but eventually exits. GHOST suddenly wakes up and looks at JON SNOW. JON SNOW's eyes snap open and he gasps for breath.
DAVOS,Easy easy. Easy.DAVOS ushers JON SNOW back into a sitting position. MELISANDRE enters and stares at JON SNOW.
DAVOS,What do you remember?
JON SNOW,They stabbed me. Olly...he put a knife in my heart. I shouldnt be here.
DAVOS,The lady brought you back.MELISANDRE approaches JON SNOW and kneels in front of him.MELISANDRE: Afterwards after they stabbed you after you died
JON SNOW,Nothing. There was nothing at all.
MELISANDRE,The Lord let you come back for a reason. Stannis was not the prince who was promised but someone has to be.
DAVOS,Could you give us a moment?MELISANDRE rises and exits the room. DAVOS closes the door behind her grabs a stool and sits down in front of JON SNOW.
DAVOS,You were dead. And now youre not. Thats completely fucking mad seems to me. I can only imagine how it seems to you.
JON SNOW,I did what I thought was right. And I got murdered for it. And now Im back. Why?
DAVOS,I dont know. Maybe well never know. What does it matter? You go on. You fight for as long as you can. You clean up as much of the shit as you can.
JON SNOW,I dont know how to do that. I thought I did but...I failed.
DAVOS,Good. Now go fail again.CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - COURTYARDDOLOROUS EDD TORMUND the faithful Nights Watch members
TORMUND,They think youre some kind of god. The man who returned from the dead.
JON SNOW,Im not a god.
TORMUND,I know that.TORMUND moves closer to JON SNOW and whispers in his ear.
TORMUND,I saw your pecker. What kind of god would have a pecker that small?JON SNOW and TORMUND both chuckle and embrace. JON SNOW winces then spies DOLOROUS EDD and begins walking towards him. They embrace and JON SNOW winces again.
DOLOROUS EDD,Your eyes are still brown. Is that still you in there?
JON SNOW,I think so. Hold off on burning my body for now.DOLOROUS EDD laughs.
DOLOROUS EDD,Thats funny. You sure thats still you in there?Both men laugh.

GILLY,You all right?
SAMWELL,Yes. Yes Im fine.
GILLY,Did I ever tell you I used to think the sea was called the see because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see?
SAMWELL,I dont think so.
GILLY,Sea see. Theyre spelled different but they sound the same.
SAMWELL,Yeah they do.
GILLY,It was before I learned how to read obviously.SAMWELL scrunches up his face.
GILLY,Sam are you going to be sick?SAMWELL shakes his head and then vomits into the bucket. GILLY retrieves a water skin and hands it to SAMWELL. He washes out his mouth with water.
GILLY,Wont be long. Well be in the south soon. Im excited to see Oldtown. Captain says its the most beautiful city in Westeros. Are you going to vomit again?
SAMWELL,No. No no no. The Citadel doesnt admit women. There wont be a place for you there or for Little Sam.
GILLY,I stayed at Castle Black. Theres no women allowed there.
SAMWELL,The Citadel isnt Castle Black. I dont have a Jon Snow or a Maester Aemon to help me bend the rules.
GILLY,Ill stay in Oldtown then.
SAMWELL,By yourself? With a baby and no money?GILLY stands.
GILLY,So if were not going to Oldtown where are you taking me?

ARTHUR,We werent there.
KINGSGUARD,Your friend the usurper would lie beneath the ground if we had been.

NED and the two remaining men advance on ARTHUR. ARTHUR deflects their blows again and slices the throat of another man
BRAN,Hes better than my father.

THREE-EYED RAVEN,Time to go.

THREE-EYED RAVEN,No.
BRAN,He heard me.
THREE-EYED RAVEN,Maybe. Maybe he heard the wind.
BRAN,He heard me.
THREE-EYED RAVEN,The past is already written. The ink is dry.
BRAN,Whats in that tower? I want to go back there.
THREE-EYED RAVEN,Ive told you many times stay too long where you dont belong and you will never return.
BRAN,Why do I want to return? So I can be a cripple again? So I can talk to an old man in a tree?
THREE-EYED RAVEN,You think I wanted to sit here for 1 000 years watching the world from a distance as the roots grew through me?
BRAN,So why did you?
THREE-EYED RAVEN,I was waiting for you.
BRAN,I dont want to be you.
THREE-EYED RAVEN,I dont blame you. You wont be here forever. You wont be an old man in a tree. But before you leave you must learn.

BLOODRIDER,Hey Great Khaleesi. Move your ass.DAENERYS approaches a domed structure. KHAL MORO and two of his Bloodriders are waiting for atop their horses.
KHAL MORO,Welcome home Khaleesi.Another Bloodrider ushers DAENERYS into the building. Inside DAENERYS stands in front of a platform atop which a middle-aged Dothraki woman is standing. A group of younger Dothraki women encircle DAENERYS. They speak in Dothraki.
DOTHRAKI WOMAN,Go.The Bloodriders who ushered DAENERYS in exit. The older Dothraki woman nods to the younger women who swarm DAENERYS and remove all of her clothing.
DAENERYS,What are you doing?! Take your hands off me! I will have your heads!One of the younger woman approaches DAENERYS with a simple brown garment which DAENERYS takes and wears.
DAENERYS,You have made a mistake. One you will regret. I am the wife of the Great Khal.
DOTHRAKI MATRON,We know who you are. I remember you eating the stallions heart. Why didnt you come to us after Khal Drogo died?
DAENERYS,Because I am Daenerys Stormborn the Breaker of Chains the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons. My place is not here with you.
DOTHRAKI MATRON,You were the wife of the Great Khal. You thought he would conquer the world with you at his side. He didnt. I was the wife of the Great Khal. Khal Savo. I thought he would conquer the world with me at his side. Youre young. We were all young once. But we all understand the way things are. You will learn as well if you are fortunate enough to stay with us.
DAENERYS,Where else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen.
DOTHRAKI MATRON,Yes. Immediately after the death of their khal. But you went out into the world. That is forbidden. All the khalasars have returned for the Khalar Vezhven. They will decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved. And now they must decide what to do with Khal Drogos silver-haired widow. With luck your place will be here with us Mother of Dragons. It is the best you can hope for
VARYS,I dont know how you stand it in all that leather.Two Unsullied usher a woman into the room.
VARYS,If we could have the room.All the Unsullied guards exit.
VARYS,You look lovely today my dear. You really do. How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat.
WOMAN,If youre going to torture me just call them back and get on with it.
VARYS,I am not a torturer.VARYS stands.
VARYS,Though it so often is what people deserve.VARYS approaches the woman.
VARYS,And it does provide answers. But theyre usually the wrong answers. My job is to find the right answers. Do you know how I do that? I do it by making people happy. Id like to make you happy Vala. Thats your name isnt it
VARYS,Thats all right. I know who you are and what youve done. Youve done a lot. Youve sacrificed your body for a cause which is more than most people do. And youve helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons.
VALA,The Unsullied and the Second Songs are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history.
VARYS,I understand. Well that makes perfect sense from your perspective. I have a different perspective of course. I think its important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours. Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy. That is how you pronounce it -- Dom? Im afraid I dont really speak the language. Such a handsome boy. Those big
VALA,Yes youre a true liberator arent you? You wont torture me
VARYS,Children are blameless. I have never hurt them. Your boy is in no immediate danger this I swear to you. But between us dear
VALA,If I tell you anything theyll kill me. So either you kill me or they do.
VARYS,Yes from your perspective this is a problem. There is a third option
VARYS,Though Im afraid well have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it. Far too heavy for me. The boat sails at dawn. You need to decide now.

TYRION,What should we do while we wait? To pass the time what should we do? What should we talk about?MISSANDEI and GREY WORM look at each other then at TYRION.
TYRION,You speak 19 languages. You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things.MISSANDEI says nothing.
TYRION,You two you spend a great deal of time together. What would you be talking about if I werent here?
GREY WORM,Patrol. When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied. What we see on patrol. Who we captured on patrol.
TYRION,Thats good. Thats very good.TYRION stands and carries his wine glass over to the decanter to refill it.
TYRION,But thats a report. I was thinking more of a conversation. A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms.
MISSANDEI,Who said this?
TYRION,Me. Just now. All right no conversations. Lets play a game.TYRION returns to the table. GREY WORM and MISSANDEI say nothing.
TYRION,You dont play games either one of you ever?
GREY WORM,Games are for children.
MISSANDEI,My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games.
TYRION,There thats a start.
MISSANDEI,Only the girls.
TYRION,Oh no no no. Not that
MISSANDEI,We do not drink.
TYRION,Until you do.GREY WORM and MISSANDEI look interrogatively at TYRION.
TYRION,Alright. No drinking. We can play without drinking. Its a wonderful game. I invented it. Heres how it works. I make a statement about your past. If Im wrong I drink. And if Im right -- Maybe we cant play without drinking.VARYS enters the room.
TYRION,Oh you took your time.
VARYS,Sorry. I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy. Some things you cant rush.
MISSANDEI,You found out?
VARYS,The good masters of Astapor. And the wise masters of Yunkai. With help from their friends in Volantis.
TYRION,You see? You dont even have to worry about the local rebellion. We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it.
GREY WORM,We conquered Asatapor and Yunkai once. We will do it again and execute the Masters.
TYRION,If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?
GREY WORM,If we do not fight them how can we stop them?
MISSANDEI,We cannot. The Masters only speak one language. They spoke it to me for many years. I know it better than my mother tongue. If we want them to hear us we must speak it back to them. May it be the last thing they ever hear.TYRION nods.
TYRION,You may be right.
GREY WORM,So we will fight them?
TYRION,Possibly.
MISSANDEI,Possibly?
TYRION,Its a conversation.TYRION turns to VARYS.
TYRION,Tell me can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor the wise Masters of Yunkai
VARYS,Of course. Man can be fickle but birds always trust.INT. RED KEEP - VAULTSA group of Varys' child spies are gathered together. One LITTLE BIRD picks up a model of a planet. Another child plays with an hourglass.

ARTHUR,Better.
QYBURN,And your father?
ARTHUR,No ones seen him.
QYBURN,And no one will. That worked out rather nicely.
LITTLE BIRD,Will Lord Varys ever come back?
QYBURN,I dont think so. Do you miss him?
LITTLE BIRD,He was nice.
ARTHUR,He called us his little birds. He gave us sweets.QYBURN stands up and walks to a table.
QYBURN,Its funny you should mention that. Guess what I happened to find today. Candied plums from Dorne.He nods at the boxes. Eeach child picks one. They nibble at the plums.
QYBURN,Now remember if any of your friends like sweets or need help they can always come to me. All I need in return are whispers.The door opens. GREGOR walks in
QYBURN,No need to be afraid. This is Ser Gregor. Hes friends with all my friends.GREGOR looks at the children. They stare at him motionless.
QYBURN,Run along now.The children run up the stairs.
CERSEI,Varys's little birds?
QYBURN,Your little birds now your Grace.JAIME is admiring GREGOR.
JAIME,What did you do to him exactly? I haven't been able to get a clear answer.
QYBURN,Oh a number of things.
JAIME,Does he understand what were saying? I mean to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place.GREGOR turns his head to JAIME. JAIME recoils.
QYBURNS,He understands well enough.
JAIME,So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrows head like a melon.
CERSEI,The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him. Ser Gregor will cant face them all. And he wont have to. Hell only have to face one.
JAIME,Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?
CERSEI,Not yet.
JAIME,That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching.
CERSEI,Dont stop at the city. I want little birds in Dorne in Highgarden in the North. If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it. If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit
MAESTER PYCELLE,As bad as Lord Varys was Varys was Qyburn is worse. I told them all. I told them. Hes arrogant dangerous. You dont get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason. And no one listened to my advice
MAESTER PYCELLE,And what he's done to Gregor Clegane is an abomination. We never sanctioned this this experiment. And I for one think it would be in our best interest to have the beast dest --MAESTER PYCELLE notices the new guests. He farts.

CERSEI,Thank you for bringing it up. Its well past time we addressed the abuses I endured.
LADY OLENNA,Margaery is the queen. You are not the queen because youre not married to the king. I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family.
KEVAN,This is a Small Council meeting. You have no position on the Small Council.
JAIME,Im Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council.
CERSEI,Grand Maester Pycelle would you sanction that statement?
MAESTER PYCELLE,Well um...I would say Ser Gerold Hightower had a seat on the Mad Kings council. Of course that was the Mad King. King Robert saw things differently.JAIME pushes two chairs to the table. JAIME and CERSEI sit down. MAESTER PYCELLE keeps his mouth. The members of the Council look at JAIME and CERSEI.
CERSEI,What about Myrcellas death Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?
JAIME,The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne. We've got a lot to discuss. All of us together.
CERSEI,And seeing as you cannot make us leave we best get on with it.
KEVAN,No we cannot make you leave. And you cannot make us stay. Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all.One by one KEVAN LANNISTER
HIGH SPARROW,Oh your Grace.
TOMMEN,My mother would like to see her daughters final resting place.
HIGH SPARROW,Oh I'm sorry
TOMMEN,When will it be possible?
HIGH SPARROW,When she's fully atoned for her sins.
TOMMEN,Youve cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city. That wasnt a full atonement?
HIGH SPARROW,No. She must stand trial before seven septons so we can learn the true extant of her sins.
TOMMEN,I want you to let her see Myrcellas resting place.Several Faith Militant gather behind the HIGH SPARROW.
TOMMEN,I am the king.
HIGH SPARROW,You are.
TOMMEN,And what does that mean to you?
HIGH SPARROW,It means a great deal to me. The crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world. Do you know who told me that? Your mother.TOMMEN walks closer to the HIGH SPARROW. He guards tense.
TOMMEN,My mother who is unclean? My mother who still needs to atone after all youve put her through?The HIGH SPARROW signs that his guards need to leave. They leave. TOMMEN puts his hand in the air and points to his guards. They leave. HIGH SPARROW closes the book lying on the table behind him.
HIGH SPARROW,How do you think the Mother Above first came to us? How did men and women first come to feel the Mothers presence? It was through their own mothers. There is a great deal of falsehood in Cersei you know that. But when she speaks of you the Mothers love outshines it all. Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world. Because it doesnt come from this world. But you know that. Youve felt it. Youve seen her when she talks to you.
TOMMEN,Yes.
HIGH SPARROW,Its a great gift. One I never had. Envy. One more thing for me to atone for.HIGH SPARROW points to a bench in the room.
HIGH SPARROW,You Grace may I? Do you mind? It's my knees.
TOMMEN,Of course.HIGH SPARROW sighs and sits down.
HIGH SPARROW,When your mother made her walk of atonement she did it to get back to you.
TOMMEN,I still dont understand why you want to put her through any more than she's already endured.
HIGH SPARROW,Its not what I want. Its what the gods want. They make their will known to us and its up to us to either accept or reject it.The HIGH SPARROW palms the seat next to him.
HIGH SPARROW,Please.TOMMEN sits down next to him.
HIGH SPARROW,If were to be just and good then we accept it all of us
TOMMEN,My grandfather once said something similar. Except for the part about the gods.
HIGH SPARROW,The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not. As they work through your mother. Theres so much good in all of us. The best we can do is to help each other bring it out.INT.

WAIF,Thats a short list. That cant be everyone you want to kill.ARYA stands up and holds her staff out at the WAIF. Cut back to the pair sitting across from each other.

ARYA,Which name would you like a girl to speak?Cut back to the fighting platform. ARYA and the WAIF exchange blows but ARYA knocks back the WAIF.

JAQEN,If a girl tells me her name I will give her eyes back.
ARYA,A girl has no name.
JAQEN,Come.ARYA walks to the well. JAQEN gives ARYA a bowl of water. ARYA hesitates to drink it.
JAQEN,If a girl is truly no one she has nothing to fear.ARYA drinks the water. She closes her eyes. She slowly opens them to reveal the blindness has left them. She looks to JAQEN.

RAMSAY,The Umbers are a famously loyal house.
LORD KARSTARK,Famously loyal to the Starks.
SMALLJON,And you Lord Karstark? Your people share blood with the Starks dont they?  But here we are. Times change.
RAMSAY,When my father became Warden of the North your house refused to pledge their banners.
SMALLJON,Your father was a cunt.
RAMSAY,My beloved father the Warden --
SMALLJON,Your father was a cunt and thats why you killed him.  I mightve done the same to my father if he hadnt have done me the favor of dying on his own.
RAMSAY,My father was poisoned by our enemies.
SMALLJON,Mmm.
RAMSAY,Why have you come to Winterfell Lord Umber?
SMALLJON,The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall.  Were farther north than any of you fuckers. Wildlings come down we always have to fight them first.  I like fighting wildlings been doing it all my life.  But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone.
RAMSAY,So now youve come seeking help?
SMALLJON,We need to help each other.  The colder it gets the farther South those goat fuckers will roam. Won't take them long to get here.
LORD KARSTARK,You think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell?
SMALLJON,If they get Jon Snow leading them maybe.  He knows this place better than we ever will.
RAMSAY,Pledge your banners to House Bolton.  Swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends.
SMALLJON,Im not kissing your fucking hand.
RAMSAY,Traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord.
SMALLJON,Im not doing that either.
RAMSAY,Why would I trust a man who wont honor tradition?
SMALLJON,Your father honored tradition. Knelt for Robb Stark. Called him King of the North. Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?
RAMSAY,Then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse.
SMALLJON,Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths. I've got a gift for you.
RAMSAY,A girl I hope. I prefer redheads.Two hooded people are dragged into the hall.
SMALLJON,A girl aye.  A wild one.SMALLJON pulls the hood off one of the people revealing OSHA. RAMSAY stands up.

OTHELL YARWICK,My mother's still living at White Harbor. Could you write her? Tell her I died fighting the wildings.
ALLISER THRONE,I had a choice Lord Commander. Betray you or betray the Nights Watch. You brought an army of wildlings into our lands. An army of muderers and raiders. If I had to do it all over knowing where Id end up I pray Id make the right choice again.

SANSA,Dont you wish we could go back to the day we left? I want to scream at myself <93>Dont go
JON SNOW,How could we know?
SANSA,I spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass I was to you. I wish I could change everything.
JON SNOW,We were children.
SANSA,I was awful just admit it.JON SNOW chuckles.
JON SNOW,You were occasionally awful. Im sure I cant have been great fun. Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played.
SANSA,Can you forgive me?
JON SNOW,Theres nothing to forgive.
SANSA,Forgive me.
JON SNOW,All right. All right I forgive you.SANSA laughs
JON SNOW,Youd think after thousands of years the Nights Watch would have learned how to make a good ale.
SANSA,Where will you go?
JON SNOW,Where will we go? If I dont watch over you Fathers ghost will come back and murder me.
SANSA,Where will we go?
JON SNOW,I cant stay here not after what happened.
SANSA,Theres only one place we can go. Home.

SANSA,Well take it back from them.
JON SNOW,I dont have an army.
SANSA,How many wildlings did you save?
JON SNOW,They didnt come here to serve me.
SANSA,They owe you their lives.SANSA stands and walks to a table. She places her bowl down on it.
SANSA,You think theyll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?
JON SNOW,Sansa.
SANSA,Winterfell is our home. Its ours and Aryas and Brans and Rickons. Wherever they are it belongs to our family. We have to fight for it.
JON SNOW,Im tired of fighting.JON SNOW stands and turns to face SANSA.
JON SNOW,Its all Ive done since I left home. Ive killed brothers of the Nights Watch. Ive killed wildlings. Ive killed men that I admire. I hanged a boy younger than Bran. I fought and I lost.

LITTLEFINGER,My lord. Come and see.LITTLEFINGER ushers ROBIN to the rear of the carriage.
LITTLEFINGER,I missed your name day. Go on.ROBIN and LITTLEFINGER pull a sheet from the back of the carriage revealing a cage with a falcon inside. The falcon squawks. ROBIN gasps.
ROBIN,A falcon!LITTLEFINGER: A gyrfalcon. The greatest and rarest of birds.
YOHN ROYCE,Last time I saw you Baelish
LITTLEFINGER,Indeed I was.
YOHN ROYCE,And yet not long ago we received reports that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell.
LITTLEFINGER,On our way to the Fingers we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men. Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting.
YOHN ROYCE,Do you take me for a fool?
LITTLEFINGER,Tell me Lord Royce
YOHN ROYCE,Slander a man in his own home you might find yourself crossing swords with him.
LITTLEFINGER,Your home is the Vale. The Lord of the Vale stands before us. And only his judgment concerns me.YOHN ROYCE looks to ROBIN.
ROBIN,Shall we throw him through the Moon Door?The surrounding knights begin to approach YOHN ROYCE. YOHN ROYCE walks closer to ROBIN.
YOHN ROYCE,My lord. My lord I have always been faithful to House Arryn. To your father
ROBIN,Do you believe him Uncle Petyr?YOHN ROYCE turns back to look at LITTLEFINGER.
LITTLEFINGER,Lord Royce has served the Vale well. He;s enjoyed a distinguished military career. If we could trust his absolute loyalty he would make a capable commander in the wars to come.YOHN ROYCE turns back to ROBIN.
YOHN ROYCE,You can trust my absolute loyalty my lord.
LITTLEFINGER,I think he deserves one more chance. What do you say?
ROBIN,Fine.YOHN ROYCE bows and walks a few feet away from the engagement.
LITTLEFINGER,I bring good news. My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell. I expect shes headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander. But she wont be safe there not with the Boltons after her.
ROBIN,Shes my cousin. We should help her.
LITTLEFINGER,That was my instinct as well.LITTLEFINGER turns and walks towards YOHN ROYCE.
LITTLEFINGER,Our lord has spoken. Gather the Knights of the Vale. The time has come to join the fray.
GREY WORM,You invite the enemy into our city?
TYRION,I did. As a clever man once told me <93>We make peace with our enemies
GREY WORM,I dont make peace with the queens enemies. I kill the queens enemies.
TYRION,Yes thats the military approach. And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach.TYRION and VARYS begin ascending the stairs to the Great Pyramid.
MISSANDEI,Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her.TYRION and VARYS turn back to face MISSANDEI and GREY WORM.
MISSANDEI,How many days were you a slave?TYRION stammers.
TYRION,Long enough to know.
MISSANDEI,Not long enough to understand.TYRION and VARYS proceed up the steps. MISSANDEI and GREY WORM follow.CUT TO: MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBERTYRION VARYS
YEZZAN,I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor. And somehow youve risen to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen. Its most impressive.
TYRION,And now you speak for the Good Masters of Astapor.Heres to reversals of fortune.
RAZDAL,We came here to meet the queen and instead were greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch.
TYRION,Lets make this simple shall we? Tell me what you want.
BELICHO,We want you to leave Slavers Bay. Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go.
TYRION,Queen Daenerys wont stay in Meereen forever. Her path takes her westward.
RAZDAL,When we last met I offered her ships so she could return to Westeros where she belongs. She refused them.
MISSANDEI,She refused them because hundreds of thousands of men women
RAZDAL,As they have since the dawn of time.
GREY WORM,Not anymore.
YEZZAN,You think youre a free man now? You still follow orders. Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesnt mean shes not a master.
TYRION,Friends friends
TYRION,There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing. That is the way of the world. Im not here to change the way of the world.
YEZZAN,Slavery is the way of our world.
TYRION,You dont need slaves to make money. There havent been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you. But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it. So here is the queens proposal. Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slavers Bay time to adjust to the new order.
YEZZAN,What does that mean?
TYRION,Instead of abolishing slavery overnight we will give you seven years to end the practice.The masters look at each others.
TYRION,Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses of course
YEZZAN,We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.
TYRION,Fine fine
TYRION,Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it. And as a parting gift to our honored guests<85>Three women enter. Each one sits in the lap of one of the masters.
TYRION,Give freedom a chance. See if it doesnt taste every bit as good as what came before.TYRION exits. VARYS MISSANDEI
TYRION,My friends! Large sorry...you wait so fat time.
MISSANDEI,Perhaps I should translate for you.
MAN #1,We speak the Common Tongue.
TYRION,Excellent.
MAN #2,You met with the slavers today.
TYRION,I did.
MAN #1,Our brothers and sister died fighting these scum. Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them.
TYRION,I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled.TYRION begins to descend the steps towards the men. MISSANDEI and GREY WORM follow.
TYRION,But I am not your ruler. Im not the Breaker of Chains. Im not the Unburnt. And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons.TYRION and company reach the bottom of the steps so they are face to face with the men.
MAN #1,You are a stranger here. So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?
TYRION,Because our queen chose me as her advisor. Until she returns from her travels --
MAN #2,When does she return?
TYRION,Soon. You have my word.
MAN #1,We dont know you. We dont trust you. We know Torgo Nudho. We fight with him against the Masters. We trust him.
TYRION,And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations. As commander of the Unsullied he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace.
MAN #2,You have made peace with the slavers?
TYRION,We offered terms.
MAN #1,And you Grey Worm? You want to drink wine with these men? The men who tore us from our mothers arms and sold us at auction like cattle?
GREY WORM,I am a soldier not a politician. But if there is a chance for peace -- a just peace -- we should take it.
MAN #2,Missandei you know what these men are. How can you trust them?
MISSANDEI,I do not trust them. I will never trust them.MISSANDEI pauses and looks at TYRION.
MISSANDEI,But as a wise man once said <93>We make peace with our enemies
GREY WORM,Do not use me for your lies.
TYRION,Those men respect you.
GREY WORM,They respect me because they know who I am. They know I am loyal.
TYRION,As do I.
GREY WORM,I am loyal to my queen not you. If you betray her work
TYRION,I am not betraying her work. I am trying to save her city.
MISSANDEI,You promised the slavers they could keep slavery.
TYRION,For a short time.
MISSANDEI,Seven years is not a short time for a slave.
TYRION,Youre right. Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once. War is a horror that should be ended at once. I cant do both today.
GREY WORM,You are wrong to trust these men.
TYRION,I dont trust the Masters. I trust their self-interest. Theyre trustworthy if theyre convinced that working with me is in their self-interest.
GREY WORM,You dont know them. You dont understand them. We are not human in their eyes. They look at me and see a weapon. They look at her and see a whore.
TYRION,They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast. Their contempt is their weakness. Theyll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage.
GREY WORM,You will not use them. They will use you. That is what they do.EXT. ESSOS MOUNTAIN RANGE - DAYJORAH and DAARIO are walking to the top of a mountain crag. JORAH lags behind and stops to catch his breath. DAARIO turns back to him.

JORAH,Eastern Market Western Market. When Khal Drogo died
DAARIO,What are you doing?
JORAH,Its forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.
DAARIO,Isnt it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?
JORAH,If they spot us and were unarmed well say were traders heading for the Western Market. But if they see weapons<85>
DAARIO,Youre asking a dog to hand over his teeth.

DAARIO,Im very attached to this knife.DAARIO kisses and strokes the knife then motions to hand it to JORAH. He spots the patch of greyscale on JORAHs arm through a hole in his sleeve. JORAH pinches the fabric of his sleeve together to cover up the greyscale.

JORAH,Come on.JORAN and DAARIO walk out to greet the Dothraki men. They proceed to speak in Dothraki.
JORAH,My friends...We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost. Could you show us the way back?
DOTHRAKI #1,What do you sell?
JORAH,Wine. Come down to my stall tomorrow Ill give you a cask of the Arbors finest.
DOTHRAKI #1,Youre not merchants.The Dothraki man inclines his head towards his fellow man.
DOTHRAKI #1,Get the others.The second Dothraki man runs down the alleyway. DAARIO darts after him. JORAH swings at the first Dothraki man but misses. The Dothraki man knees him in the face
DAARIO,Told you Im very attached to this knife.DAARIO tucks the dagger away in his shirt. JORAH climbs to his feet.
DAARIO,You all right?
JORAH,If they find a body with a stab wound the whole city will be looking for us.DAARIO grabs a large rock and smashes the dead Dothraki man with it several times.
DAARIO,Huh.CUT TO: VAES DOTHRAK - TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEENDAENERYS is sitting among the Dosh Khaleen. The women whisper among themselves but the leader sits beside DAENERYS. They begin to speak in Dothraki.
LEADER,Some of them dont think Dothraki should breed with foreigners. They are stupid old women. They dont realize that we have always diluted our blood. This one is Lhazareen. Her Khal found her hiding in a well after he burned her village. How old were you?
LHAZAREEN WOMAN,Twelve.
LEADER,A year later she bore her Khal a daughter. How did he show his happiness?
LHAZAREEN WOMAN,He broke my ribs.
LEADER,We are not queens here but the khals depend on us for our wisdom. Our lives have meaning.
DAENERYS,That is more than most have.
LEADER,When the khals meet for the Khalar Vezhven tomorrow night I hope they let you live out your days with us. The other possibilities are not so pleasant.
DAENERYS,I need to make water.
LEADER,You cant run from Dothraki. You know this.
DAENERYS,I will never run from Dothraki.
LEADER,Go show her.The Lhazareen woman takes DAENERYS outside the temple. They walk together.
DAENERYS,I needed fresh air. The old women stink.
LHAZAREEN WOMAN,They do stink.
DAENERYS,You must have been very young when your Khal died.
LHAZAREEN WOMAN,Sixteen.
DAENERYS,Too bad he didnt die sooner.DAENERYS and the Lhazareen woman smile at each other.
LHAZAREEN WOMAN,Yes too bad.The pair round a bend to a secluded desert outcropping.
LHAZAREEN WOMAN,Is it true you have three dragons?
DAENERYS,Mm-hmm.
LHAZAREEN WOMAN,And they breathe fire?
DAENERYS,They do. Would you like to see them one day?
LHAZAREEN WOMAN,I am Dosh Khaleen. I can never leave Vaes Dothrak until I rise as smoke from the pyre on the day I die.DAARIO grabs the Lhazareen woman from behind

DAENERYS,We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive.
JORAH,All we can do is try.
DAENERYS,No. We can do more than that. And youre going to help me.DAENERYS looks at the Lhazareen woman.
DAENERYS,And you...Have faith in me Khaleesi. Do not betray me.The Lhazareen woman nods. DAENERYS looks at DAARIO. DAARIO slowly removes his hand from her mouth.
HIGH SPARROW,If I were to let you leave right now where would you go? What would you seek out?
MARGAERY,Id go to my brother my husband
HIGH SPARROW,Of course but for you
MARGAERY,Quality takes time.
HIGH SPARROW,Yes. I imagine youve worn a year of someones life on your back. The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege. I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself. Each time I indulged I felt myself ascending to something better.
MARGAERY,And one day you walked through a graveyard and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness. Book of the Stranger verse 25.
HIGH SPARROW,You know The Seven-Pointed Star.
MARGAERY,Septa Unella reads it to me. At me.
HIGH SPARROW,Yes yes
MARGAERY,So what did you do?
HIGH SPARROW,I left to go and find them. I didnt even put on my shoes. I walked out the door and never went back.The HIGH SPARROW stands and extends his hand out to MARGAERY.
HIGH SPARROW,Come lets go and see him.
MARGAERY,Who?
HIGH SPARROW,Your brother.CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR <96> LORAS CELLMARGAERY enters her brothers cell. The door closes and locks behind her. Loras is lying on the floor.
MARGAERY,Loras. Loras.MARGAERY helps LORAS to his knees. He cries.
MARGAERY,Listen to me. You need to stay strong.
LORAS,I cant stay strong. I never was strong.
MARGAERY,You are strong. You are the future of our house the future of our family.
LORAS,I dont care about that.
MARGAERY,Shh. Have you -- have you told them that? That you dont care?
LORAS,I just want it to stop. Help me.
MARGAERY,They want me to help you. They want me told help tear you down. Thats why hes letting me see you I know it is. And if either of us give in to what they want
LORAS,Let them win. Just make it stop. Please.LORAS begins sobbing. MARGAERY embraces him.
MARGAERY,All right.CUT TO: RED KEEP <96> TOMMEN'S CHAMBERCERSEI is walking down the hall to TOMMENs chamber. She hears MAESTER PYCELLE talking.
MAESTER PYCELLE,And now how to avert disaster with our current predicament. This High Sparrow. I have dealt with fanatics of every description
CERSEI,What are you doing here?
MAESTER PYCELLE,I am advising the king on our current predicament.
CERSEi,Leave.
MAESTER PYCELL,I am a member of the Small Council. The kings small --
CERSEI,Is this a Small Council meeting?
MAESTER PYCELL,Obviously not. Im here to lend my wisdom and my support.
TOMMEN,Thank you for your counsel Grand Maester. That will be all for now.
MAESTER PYCELL,Your Grace.MAESTER PYCELLE hobbles towards the door. As he leaves he flashes CERSEI a smile. CERSEI closes the door.
CERSEI,Since Ive missed the past several Small Coucil meetings I wanted to speak to you about a few things.
TOMMEN,Ive been thinking about the High Sparrow.
CERSEI,As have we all unfortunately.
TOMMEN,We need to be careful in dealing with such a man. To prevent things from escalating any further. We have to be careful not to antagonize him. He has Margaery. We cant put her at risk. Hes dangerous.CERSEI takes TOMMEN by the chin.
CERSEI,Look at me. What did they do to me? To the kings own mother?TOMMEN looks down.
CERSEI,Its all right. It's done. Its in the past. And of course Margaerys safety is paramount.
TOMMEN,You dont like Margaery do you?
CERSEI,Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake but for everyones. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing.
TOMMEN,Mother...theres something I want to tell you. Something the High Sparrow told me.
CERSEI,Youve spoken with him?
TOMMEN,I promised him I wouldnt tell anyone. If he found out I told --
CERSEI,It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me.CUT TO: RED KEEP <96> SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBERKEVAN and LADY OLEN are waiting in the Small Council chamber for the meeting to start. CERSEI and JAIME enter.
CERSEI,The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the kings orders.KEVIN and LADY OLEN stand up.
LADY OLENNA,I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time. Youre not welcome.
CERSEI,You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with ones rivals.
LADY OLENNA,My dear you have been stripped of your dignity and authority
JAIME,Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the kings ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.
CERSEI,The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty peasant hands. In a few days
LADY OLENNA,Oh no. That cannot happen. That will not happen.
CERSEi,I agree.
JAIME,Youve got the second largest army in Westeros. You'll bring them into the city stop queen Margaerys humiliation before it starts
KEVAN,The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queens safety.
JAIME,Youll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?
KEVAN,No but if the king should call on me --
JAIME,The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead preferably
CERSEI,You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what theyve done to your son.  Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?
KEVAN,Of course I want him back.
CERSEI,Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.
KEVAN,If it doesnt go as planned the Sparrows have many friends in the city. Well have civil war. Many will die.
LADY OLENNA,Many will die no matter what we do. Better them than us.

YARA,He send us one of those pieces. Thats why I came for you.THEON sobs.
YARA,Why did you come here?
THEON,Where else could I go?
YARA,You heard father was dead and thought youd claim the crown?
THEON,No no. I only heard he died after we docked.
YARA,You happen to show up on Pyke right before the Kingsmoot?
THEON,I didnt know.
YARA,You think any Ironborn wants you to be king? After what youve done?
THEON,I dont want to be king.
YARA,What do you want?

RAMSAY,You served the Starks?
OSHA,Aye. They put me in chains and put a sword at my throat so Ive served them.
RAMSAY,The Starks have been gone for a long time but you kept protecting Rickon.
OSHA,He'd fetch a good price to the right buyer. I served his family a long time. Didnt get no wages. Way I see it Im owed.
RAMSAY,Be that as it may Rickon's not yours to sell anymore. Hes mine. So what use could I possibly have for you?
OSHA,I can give you what you want.
RAMSAY,Are you sure you know what that is?OSHA comes closer and sits down on his lap. They kiss.
OSHA,Same thing men always want. And when they really want it they give it a bath first.OSHA slowly begins to reach for the knife on the table.
RAMSAY,Youre a good talker.RAMSAY grabs OSHA by her hair and yanks her head back.
RAMSAY,I like that.RAMSAY kisses OSHA'S neck. She reaches into his pants.
RAMSAY,Youre a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy.
OSHA,That so?
RAMSAY,I had to work hard to get him talking. But he talked. They all do.OSHA's hand inches closer to the knife.

KHAL MORO,And what happened? You trusted a sorceress like a fool. Your baby is dead because of you. And so is Khal Drogo.
DAENERYS,This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends. To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before. He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains.
KHAL MORO,And you were dumb enough to believe him?
DAENERYS,And here now
KHAL MORO,All right. No Dosh Khaleen for you. Instead well take turns fucking you. And then well let our bloodriders fuck you.KHAL MORO stands.

MAN #1,Weve never had a queen. Not once.
YARA,There are many things weve never done. Weve never made our mark upon the world. The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance. Then they swat us down. They conquer us

EURON,Explains why you think a woman can be king.
YARA,When did you return
EURON,A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.
YARA,Im glad youre here. Now I know what my first act as queen will be. To execute the man who killed my father.The men murmur to each other.
EURON,I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it werent for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldnt win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.
THEON,That would have been hard to do. You werent here. Last I heard
EURON,Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?The Ironborn laugh.
EURON,Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?
THEON,You were gone. Yara was here. Being Ironborn. Leading Ironborn. Getting ready to bring us back to glory.
EURON,And how will she do that?
YARA,I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.
EURON,Right idea
YARA,Youre going to seduce the Dragon Queen?
EURON,Im not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together were going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasnt born to be king.

AERON,Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.YARA
AERON,What is dead may never die
AERON,What is dead may never die.

EURON,Where are my niece and nephew? Lets go murder them.EURON leads AERON and the Ironborn up to a seaside cliff. They stare out at the ocean. A fleet of ships is sailing away from Pyke.
AERON,They stole our best ships.
EURON,Wont be enough to save them.EURON turns to face the Ironborn.
EURON,Go back to your homes. Chop down every tree you can find. Quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks. I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world.
DAENERYS,I banished you twice. You came back twice. And you saved my life. So I cant take you back and I cant send you away.DAENERYS approaches JORAH
JORAH,You must send me away.JORAH rolls up his sleeve to reveal the greyscale covering his forearm.
DAENERYS,Is there a cure?
JORAH,I dont know.
DAENERYS,How long does it take?
JORAH,I dont know that either. But Ive seen what happens when it goes far enough. Ill end things before that.DAENERYS begins to cry.
DAENERYS,Im sorry. Im so sorry.
JORAH,Dont be. All Ive ever wanted was to serve you. Tyrion Lannister was right. I love you. Ill always love you. Goodbye

GREY WORM,None.
VARYS,And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men.
GREY WORM,Two
VARYS,So its safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.
GREY WORM,For now.
VARYS,For now is the best we get in our profession.
TYRION,Its not enough.
VARYS,Considering the city was on the brink of civil war
TYRION,Its not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons
MISSANDEI,The people know who brought them freedom.
TYRION,Yes
VARYS,Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?
TYRION,Who said anything about <93>him<94>?CUT TO: MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID AUDIENCE CHAMBERTYRION and VARYS stand on the plateau above the audience chamber. A woman stans  at the bottom of the steps
MAN,You stand in the presence of Kinvara
TYRION,Welcome to Meereen.KINVARA stops on the middle plateau.
TYRION,Thats about the extent of my Valyrian.KINVARA says nothing.
TYRION,Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.TYRION looks at VARYS. KINVARA says nothing.
TYRION,The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --
KINVARA,You dont need to persuade me. I came to help.KINVARA continues up the steps.
KINVARA,Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.
TYRION,Yes.
KINVARA,She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.
TYRION,She did indeed.
KINVARA,Her dragons are fire made flesh
TYRION,Ideally wed avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
KINVARA,You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed. And while shes gone
TYRION,Id settle for obeyed.
KINVARA,I will summon my most eloquent priests. They will spread the word. Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come.
TYRION,That sounds most excellent --
VARYS,A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He
TYRION,Wed be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.
VARYS,I suppose its hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isnt that the whole point of being a fanatic? Youre always right. Everything is the Lords will.
KINVARA,Everything is the Lords will. But men and women make mistakes. Even honest servants of the Lord.
VARYS,And you
TYRION,My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion
KINVARA,Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason. Terrible things happen for a reason. Take what happened to you
KINVARA,Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?VARYS scrunches up his face and stares at KINVARA. KINVARA smiles.
KINVARA,We serve the same queen. If you are her true friend

JON SNOW,We cant defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive
DAVOS,Aside from the Starks and the Boltons
DAVOS,The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons
SANSA,The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang. But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.
DAVOS,I beg your pardon
SANSA,How well do you know the North
DAVOS,Precious little
SANSA,My father always said Northerners are different. More loyal
DAVOS,They may well be loyal
JON SNOW,There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover
SANSA,The North remembers. They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it
DAVOS,I dont doubt it. But Jon doesnt have the Stark name.
SANSA,No
SANSA,Jon is every bit as much Ned Starks son as Ramsay is Roose Boltons. Ant there are also the Tullys. Theyre not Northern
DAVOS,I didnt know the Tullys still had an army.
SANSA,My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.
JON SNOW,How do you know that?
SANSA,Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.
DAVOS,Thats good. The Blackfish is a legend. His support would mean a great deal. Stark
BRIENNE,Ive sworn to protect you
SANSA,You heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.

MEERA,Im so sorry.The wights converge on MEERA and BRAN. Moments before they reach them a cloaked rider appears. The riders horse kicks one of the wights out of the way then the rider extends a chain which lights on fire at the end. Two wights charge and the rider hits them both with the chain
RIDER,Come with me now.A large group of wights approaches.
RIDER,The dead dont rest.The rider leans down and hoists BRAN up onto his horse. MEERA takes the riders hand and joins them on the horses back. The three of them ride off into the forest with wights in pursuit.
GILLY,Its so green.
SAM,Oh yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple elm
GILLY,Youre nervous. Youre a nervous talker.SAM looks away.
GILLY,Thats not any better being a nervous mute.
SAM,I didnt think Id ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and well threaten to kill me if I didnt. A person just doesnt feel welcome at that point.GILLY looks at LITTLE SAM.
SAM,And I certainly didnt expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.
GILLY,That Little Sam is your baby.
SAM,Yes now thats very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild hell take you in. Hell get an education. Hell learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?
GILLY,What did you tell your family about me?
SAM,I told them I met you in the North.
GILLY,Did you tell them how far north?
SAM,Well it wasnt a very large piece of parchment.
GILLY,You didnt tell them where Im really from? You didnt tell them Im a wildling?
SAM,The thing is...my father doesnt like wildlings. He hoped Id make a man of myself by <93>killing some bloody wildlings <94> so its probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible.GILLY looks out the window.
GILLY,I think were here.SAM looks out the window. The carriage is approaching the castle on Horn Hill.CUT TO: HORN HILL - COURTYARDA party of guests is lined up at the entrance to the castle courtyard. GILLY and SAM enter. GILLY is carrying LITTLE SAM. SAMs mother MELESS and his sister TALLA

TOMMEN,Is there no other way?
HIGH SPARROW,Youre afraid for her?
TOMMEN,Of course Im afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.
HIGH SPARROW,Shell be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isnt your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. Shes truly opened her heart to them.
TOMMEN,Shes always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.
HIGH SPARROW,And now shes devoted to the gods as well. Would you like to see her?CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - PRAYER ROOMMARGAERY is sitting on a bench reading a book. The door opens.

MARGAERY,Well be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before.
TOMMEN,Better how? Soon the- - walk of atonement. He says theres no other way.
MARGAERY,Have you spoken to him at all the High Sparrow?
TOMMEN,Yes a few times. Have you?
MARGAERY,Yes I have. Hes not quite what we thought he was is he?TOMMEN scrunches up his face. MARGAERY chuckles and turns away.
MARGAERY,You think Im mad. I sound mad.
TOMMEN,No. No you dont. You- - you could never. Youre right hes not. Hes a lot more- -
MARGAERY,He is. Theres something about him. His way of looking at the world. Its not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. Its taken me a while. Hes helped me.
TOMMEN,What are you talking about? Youre a good person. Youve always been a good person. Youre the best person I know.MARGAERY chuckles and retrieves her book from the bench.
TOMMEN,I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.
MARGAERY,Ah yes I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed though. Ive had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good. All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did. There were so many lies in those stories.
TOMMEN,I dont understand.MARGAERY rushes to TOMMEN and takes his hand.
MARGAERY,Its all right. It really is. Its such a relief to let go of those lies.MARGAERY leads him to the bench and they sit down on it together.
TOMMEN,What about Loras?
MARGAERY,I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins dont erase that purity they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all.
GILLY,Its hard to walk in this.

DICKON,Well no. We havent been able to cure that one yet. This is last weeks.
SAM,Oh of course. Sorry. Long journey.
DICKON,Brought it down from 70 yards. One shot.
SAM,Oh thats a fair distance.
DICKON,So do you do much hunting up at the wall?
SAM,Oh yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall you dont hunt you dont eat.
DICKON,Mm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?
SAM,Rabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say <93>we <94> its my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh and Gilly. Shes- - shes quite a good hunter as well. Um huntress.
MELESSA,I imagine its common where youre from. We once met a man Lord Umber from Last Hearth wasnt it Randyll
TALLA,Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us. I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.
RANDYLL,Thats enough of that.
MELESSA,Samwell would you care for more bread?
SAM,Oh yes. Yes please. Thank you Mother.A servant girl retrieves the basket of bread. She holds out the basket to SAM. SAM reaches for the bread.
RANDYLL,Not fat enough already?SAM waves the servant away.
SAM,I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander. He wants me to- -
RANDYLL,I read your letter. Youre to be a maester.
SAM,Yes. And once I have my chain Ill return to Castle Black.
RANDYLL,I thought the Nights Watch might make a man of you. Something resembling a man at least. You managed to stay soft and fat.SAM puts down his utensils.
RANDYLL,Your nose buried in books. Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men. Ill wager you still cant sit a horse or wield a sword.
MELESSA,Randyll to be maester of the Nights Watch is a great honor.
GILLY,He can wield a sword. He killed a Thenn. He killed a White Walker.DICKON laughs.
DICKON,Theres no such thing.
GILLY,I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black. He drove a dagger into the walkers heart. He risked his own life to save mine more than once. Hes a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.
RANDYLL,Your way down to Castle Black? Where did he kill a white walker? Where are you from? Howd you come to meet my son?
GILLY,The Nights Watch came to our keep.
RANDYLL,Where?
SAM,Gilly.
GILLY,North of the Wall.
RANDYLL,North of the Wall? Youre a Wildling. The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son. See that sword?RANDYLL points to a blade mounted on a mantle beside the table.
RANDYLL,Its called Heartsbane. Its been in our family for 500 years. Its Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world. Its supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Moles Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it. And you got what you were after didnt you? A bastard. A half-breed bastard. Your invitation into our home.MELESSA throws down her utensils and stands. She walks to GILLY.

MELESSA,Ive lost my appetite.
RANDYLL,He dishonors us.
MELESSA,You dishonor yourself.
RANDYLL,Your mothers a fine woman. Youre not worthy of her. To please her Ill take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens. The bastard will be raised here. But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill.CUT TO: HORN HILL - GILLYS GUEST CHAMBERGILLY is sitting at the foot of the bed. LITTLE SAM is in a crib beside her.

SAM,First light.LITTLE SAM fusses and reaches for SAM. SAM takes his hand.
SAM,Say good-bye to him for me.SAM starts off but GILLY stands and gets in his way. She places her hands on his chest and kisses him.
GILLY,Youre not what he thinks you are Sam. He doesnt know what you are.
SAM,Good-bye Gilly.SAM walks to the door. He turns back and stares at GILLY before closing the doors. GILLY looks around the guest chamber and then goes to LITTLE SAM. She pulls his blanket up higher and comforts him. SAM bursts back into the room.

CAPTAIN,Company halt! Face front! Turn!The soldiers form up and turn to face the steps.
HIGH SPARROW,Lord Tyrell.MACE nods at the HIGH SPARROW.
HIGH SPARROW,Ser Jaime.
JAIME,Sorry to interrupt. Were here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell. Give them to us and well be on our way.
HIGH SPARROW,I dont have the authority to give them to you. And you dont have the authority to take them.The crowd murmurs. JAIME ushers his horse forward and rides it up the steps. He halts in front of the Faith Militant.
CAPTAIN,Lock spears!The soldiers grunt and point their spears towards the Faith Militant.
JAIME,I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon First of His Name.
HIGH SPARROW,The gods dont recognize his authority in this matter.
JAIME,You already insulted one great house. It wont happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street.
HIGH SPARROW,To die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us. We yearn for it. But there is no call for it today. There will be no walk of atonement.The crowd murmurs. OLEN motions to MACE with her fan. MACE motions to one of the high ranking soldiers who nods to the Captain.
CAPTAIN,Order up!The soldiers return to a relaxed position.
HIGH SPARROW,Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the Seven.The doors to the Great Sept of Baelor open. TOMMEN emerges accompanied by the Kingsguard. The crowd murmurs. JAIME looks back at OLEN who looks down. TOMMEN and the Kingsguard walk down the steps until TOMMEN stands beside MARGAERY. TOMMEN takes MARGAERYs hand.
HIGH SPARROW,Together we announce a new age of harmony. A holy alliance between the Crown and the Faith.The crowd cheers.
WOMAN,Long live King Tommen and bless you Queen Margaery!TOMMEN looks at JAIME. JAIME shakes his head. TOMMEN looks at the crowd.
TOMMEN,The crown and the faith are the twin pillars upon which the world rests. Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.The crowd cheers.
MACE,Whats happening?
OLENNA,Hes beaten us. Thats whats happening.The HIGH SPARROW smiles at JAIME.CUT TO: RED KEEP - THRONE ROOMThe room is lined with soldiers on either side. TOMMEN is sitting on the throne. KEVAN stands beside him. JAIME stands at the foot of the throne and removes his armor letting it drop to the floor.
TOMMEN,When you attack the Faith you attack the Crown. Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
JAIME,Ive been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born. You dont have to do this. You dont have to do anything.
TOMMEN,I have to answer to the gods.
JAIME,Not when youre sitting in that chair.
TOMMEN,The Crowns decision on this matter is final.
JAIME,Will I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods mercy?TOMMEN and KEVAN look at each other.
TOMMEN,You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years. And you will continue to do so. But not in this city.
WALDER,Youve lost it?
BLACK WALDER,Yes father.
WALDER,Its a castle not a bloody sheep. Presumably you still know where it is. You didnt lose Riverrun. You let the Blackfish take it from you.
LOTHAR,He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.
WALDER,You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding. You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave. Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him you couldnt find him. Thats what it means to lose something. Now hes come back and taken Riverrun.
BLACK WALDER,I dont think its fair to blame us- -
WALDER,For 300 years we kissed Tully boots swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners. Not again. Riverrun is ours. Take it back.
BLACK WALDER,We dont have the men.
WALDER,Weve got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.
BLACK WALDER,The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.
LOTHAR,The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us raiding our supply trains and camps.
BLACK WALDER,Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.WALDER slaps his daughter on on the buttocks.
WALDER,If I want excuses Ill put her in charge. Theyre laughing at us. All across the Riverlands right down to Kings Landing theyre laughing at us.WALDER stands. Many family members stare at him.
WALDER,I hear it in my sleep! Im not dead yet unfortunately for you. And Ill not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter. Take that castle back.
LOTHAR,Hell never yield Father.
WALDER,Oh hell yield.WALDER nods at some servants at the rear of the hall. LOTHAR looks back at the servants. The servants exit. WALDER points first at LOTHAR and then at BLACK WALDER.
WALDER,Youll show him the knife you used to kill Robb Starks child in his whore mothers belly and youll show him the knife you used to open his nieces throat. And youll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place. His nephew.WALDER pulls his daughter into his lap. The servants return ushering in a man bound in chains. They undo his chains. The man is EDMURE TULLY. EDMURE stares at WALDER.
WALDER,Cheer up Lord Edmure. Youre going home.
JAIME,Im being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey cant manage it on his own because hes 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.JAIME stands and paces.
CERSEI,BEtter youre elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.
JAIME,Im not going to the Riverlands.JAIME pours himself a cup of wine.
CERSEI,What then?
JAIME,Im going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyones ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows. Ill take them to the sept and Ill remove the High Sparrows head and every other sparrow head I can find.
CERSEI,You cant.
JAIME,He has our son! He stole our son! Hes torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?
CERSEI,We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow you wont leave the sept alive. And without you this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are
JAIME,Youll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.
CERSEI,It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. Theyve made us both stronger all of them.CERSEI stands and approaches JAIME.
CERSEI,They have no idea how strong we are. No idea what were going to do to them.JAIME and CERSEI embrace and kiss. CERSEI whispers into JAIMEs ear.
CERSEI,Weve always been together. Well always be together. Were the only two people in the world.They resume kissing.
MEERA,Why did you help us?The rider looks at MEERA from behind his face mask.
RIDER,The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.
MEERA,The Three-Eyed Ravens dead.
RIDER,Now he lives again.BRAN startles as he comes out of a vision. MEERA goes to him.
RIDER,When I last saw you you were a boy. A fearless boy. Loved to climb the castle walls frighten his mother.
BRAN,Who are you?The rider removes his hood and face mask. He is BENJEN STARK. His skin is gray and he has blemishes on his face.
BRAN,Uncle Benjen. The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.
BENJEN,I led a ranging party deep into the North to find White Walkers. They found us. A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice. Left me there to die. To turn. The Children found me. Stopped the walkers magic from taking hold.
BRAN,How?
BENJEN,The same way they made the Walkers in the first place. You saw it yourself.
BRAN,Dragonglass. A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.
BENJEN,You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.
BRAN,I didnt have time to learn. I cant control anything.BENJEN stands and walks over to BRAN and MEERA.
BENJEN,You must learn to control it before the Night King comes.BENJEN kneels beside BRAN and offers him a cup.
BENJEN,Drink.BRAN takes the cup and drinks.
BENJEN,One way or another he will find his way to the world of men. When he does you will be there waiting for him. And you will be ready.
DAARIO,Everything all right?
DAENERYS,How many days ride to Meereen?
DAARIO,A week at best.
DAENERYS,How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?
DAARIO,Dothraki and all their horses the Unsullied the Second Sons- - 1 000 ships easily. Probably more.
DAENERYS,And who has that many?
DAARIO,Nobody.
DAENERYS,Nobody yet.
DAARIO,So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros. What then?
DAENERYS,I take what is mine.
DAARIO,You werent made to sit on a chair in a palance.
DAENERYS,What was I made for?
DAARIO,Youre a conqueror Daenerys Stormborn.The wind howls. DAENERYS stares beyond the mountain crag
DAENERYS,Wait here.DAENERYS rides away from the horde and around the bend. Time passes. The Dothraki are growing antsy.
DAARIO,Im going after her. Wait for me here.DAARIO starts off but stops when a dragons roar erupts from the sky. The Dothraki look around. The shadow of a dragon appears on the mountainside. DROGON flies over the Dothraki horde with DAENERYS on its back. DROGON circles around and lands in front of the horde. He roars.
DAENERYS,Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all.The Dothraki cheer.
DAENERYS,I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?The Dothraki cheer.
DAENERYS,Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?The Dothraki cheer.
DAENERYS,Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains?The Dothraki cheer.
DAENERYS,Are you with me?The Dothraki continue to cheer.
DAENERYS,Now and always?DROGON spreads his wings and roars.
MAN,Thats it. Get it to the top.
MAN #2,Steady. Steady.BROTHER RAY is standing beneath the framing
RAY,Up she goes.RAY turns to another man and slaps him on the back.
RAY,Hey
RAY,Here you are
RAY,Oh
RAY,In all my days Ive never seen a man swing an ax like that. How many men did it take to cut you down?
SANDOR,Just one.
RAY,Ooh. he must have been some kind of monster.SANDOR sinks the ax into the log.
SANDOR,He was a woman.RAY laughs. SANDOR continues chopping. RAY walks away.CUT TO: BROTHER RAYS ENCAMPMENTA man standing beneath the church framing rings a bell. All of  the men rush down off the church framing and father at the food stations. The women divvy out food. RAY pours a cup of water and walks among the people. They are all sitting down on the ground and eating. SANDOR is sitting on a rock away from everyone else
RAY,I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.
SANDOR,Im used to it.SANDOR drinks the entire cup of water.
RAY,When I found you
RAY,I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed. Oh
SANDOR,Hate.SANDOR continues eating.
RAY,No
SANDOR,Aye
RAY,No
SANDOR,Ive heard that before. Man was talking about a different god
RAY,Well
SANDOR,Youre in the wrong line of work.
RAY,Oh
SANDOR,You didnt know me back in my time. You dont know the things Ive done.
RAY,Ive heard stories.
SANDOR,If the gods are real...why havent they punished me?
RAY,They have.RAY walks away. SANDOR stares out across the fields.
HIGH SPARROW,Your Grace. What are we reading today?
MARGAERY,The Book of the Mother
HIGH SPARROW,Ah
MARGAERY,<93>Smoothing what was jagged
HIGH SPARROW,You learn quickly. There are some who know every verse of the sacred text
MARGAERY,For year I pretended to love the poor
HIGH SPARROW,They are hard to love.The HIGH SPARROW sits down on a bench.
HIGH SPARROW,The poor disgust us because they are us
HIGH SPARROW,Can I ask you about a personal matter?
MARGAERY,Of course.MARGAERY sits on the bench beside the HIGH SPARROW.
HIGH SPARROW,The king mentioned that since your reunion
MARGAERY,No.
HIGH SPARROW,You have a duty
MARGAERY,Its just...the desires that once drove me no longer do.
HIGH SPARROW,Congress does not require desire on the womans part
MARGAERY,Forgive me. Sometimes the truth path is hard to find.
HIGH SPARROW,Hard to find and harder still to walk upon. But youve made great progress. I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.The HIGH SPARROW stands.
MARGAERY,My grandmother?
HIGH SPARROW,Yes. The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman
OLENNA,Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.
MARGAERY,Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.OLEN stands.
OLENNA,Oh
OLENNA,Youre not in your sanctuary now
MARGAERY,Grandmother.
OLENNA,...until I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.
MARGAERY,Grandmother
OLENNA,What have they done to you?
MARGAERY,You marched against the High Sparrow
OLENNA,We marched for you.
MARGAERY,The gods could have punished you and Father
OLENNA,And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?
MARGAERY,Lorass only hope is to confess his crimes and repent. If he does
OLENNA,Have you lost your mind?
MARGAERY,...and live his life as a penitent.
OLENNA,He is the heir to Highgarden
MARGAERY,He can begin again.
OLENNA,As a mindless fanatic.
MARGAERY,As a free man.
OLENNA,You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.MARGAERY stands.
MARGAERY,I am the queen. It is my duty to serve my husband the king.MARGAERY walks around the table and kneels before OLEN. Her back is to SEPTA UNELLA.
MARGAERY,But you should leave
OLENNA,I will never leave you. Never.
MARGAERY,You must.MARGAERY slips a piece of paper into OLENs hand. MARGAERYs eyes widen.
MARGAERY,Go home. Find comfort in prayer and good works.MARGAERY stands.
MARGAERY,The Mother watches over us all.OLEN stands.
OLENNA,Ill see you soon
MARGAERY,Seven blessings to you
MARGAERY,Shall we pray?CUT TO: RED KEEP - OLENS CHAMBER INNER BALCONYOLEN walks out onto the balcony and shuts the door behind her. She looks around and then unfolds the piece of paper MARGAERY placed in her hand and looks at it. There is a drawing of a rose on it. OLEN looks up and smiles.
DIM DALBA,We said wed fight with you
TORMUND,If it werent for him
DIM DALBA,Remember Mances camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look whats left of us. And if we lose this
JON SNOW,Thats whatll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons
TORMUND,The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would. He died for us. If we are not willing to do the same for him
WUN WUN,Snow.WUN WUN walks away. DIM DALBA looks at the men around him. One of them nods. DIM DALBA walks up to JON SNOW and holds out his hand. JON takes it. DIM DALBA returns to his men.
JON SNOW,Are you sure theyll come?
TORMUND,Were not clever like you southerners. When we say well do something
CERSEI,I heard you were leaving Kings Landing.
OLENNA,That is hardly your concern.
CERSEI,Your grandson is still a prisoner. Youll leave him rotting in a cell?
OLENNA,Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.
CERSEI,Youre right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.
OLENNA,Good.
CERSEI,I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.
OLENNA,I wonder if youre the worst person Ive ever met. At a certain age
CERSEI,You love your granddaughter. I love my son. Its the only truth I know. We must defend them.
OLENNA,Im leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If youre half as bright as you think you are
CERSEI,Never. Ill never leave my son.
OLENNA,Whatll you do
MAN,Pick the pace up. Keep going.
MAN #2,Keep it moving!
BRONN,Now
JAIME,Someone certainly does.JAIME looks at BRONN.
BRONN,Oh
JAIME,Youre an anointed knight. Theres quite a difference.
BRONN,Aye
JAIME,You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.
BRONN,Thats like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.
JAIME,I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.
BRONN,You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.
JAIME,And youll get all three. A Lannister always- -
BRONN,Dont say it. Dont fucking say it.BRONN ushers his horse onwards.CUT TO: RIVERRUN - FREY ENCAMPMENTJAIME and BRONN lead a group of Lannister soldiers through the encampment. Some Frey men gather around and stare at them. LOTHAR is standing at the foot of Riverrun
LOTHAR,Come out and fight us
LOTHAR,This is your last warning. Yield the castle.LOTHAR looks back at BLACK WALDER. BLACK WALDER takes the noose off of EDMUREs neck and draws a knife.
BLACK WALDER,You think I wont do it
BLACK WALDER,I sliced your nieces throat from ear to ear. And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward. Yield the castle or I cut his throat.
BRYNDEN,Go on
JAIME,Lothar
LOTHAR,Ser Jaime. We didnt know you were coming.
JAIME,<91>Cause you didnt set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8
BRONN,Good thing were friends or wed be fucking you in the ass right now.
JAIME,Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.BLACK WALDER waves at the Frey men escorting EDMURE.
BLACK WALDER,Whoa
LOTHAR,Walder.LOTHAR puts his hand out to stop BLACK WALDER
BLACK WALDER,Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.JAIME looks BLACK WALDER up and down.
JAIME,Only a fool makes threats hes not prepared to carry out. Now lets say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth
BLACK WALDER,I dont give a rats- -JAIME hits BLACK WALDER across the face with his gold hand. BLACK WALDER staggers back beside LOTHAR.
JAIME,Im here by the kings command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless youd like to take his place.
LOTHAR,Apologies
LOTHAR,Do as he says.
JAIME,The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts
BRONN,Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.
BLACK WALDER,Those are our siege towers- -
JAIME,As I said
JAIME,Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.
BRONN,A parley or a fight?
JAIME,Hes an old man.
BRONN,Youve got one hand. My moneys on the old boy.
EXT. BEAR ISLANDThe castle of House Mormont sits atop a high hill. Waterfalls pour out below. A bird screeches.CUT TO,BEAR ISLAND - CASTLE AUDIENCE CHAMBERLYAN MORMONT sits at a high table flanked by a commander and a maester. JON SNOW
JON SNOW,Lady Mormont.
LYANNA,Welcome to Bear Island.JON SNOW looks at SANSA.
SANSA,I remember when you were born
LYANNA,I doubt it. My mother wasnt a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior
JON SNOW,I served under your uncle at Castle Black
LYANNA,I think weve had enough small talk. What are you here?
JON SNOW,Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -LYAN: I remember what it said. <93>Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.<94>
JON SNOW,Robb is gone
LYANNA,As far as I understand
SANSA,I did what I had to do to survive
LYANNA,If you say so. In any case
JON SNOW,Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell
LYANNA,I understand that Im responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone elses war?JON SNOW and SANSA fall silent. DAVOS steps forward.
DAVOS,If it please
LYANNA,I dont know you
DAVOS,Davos
LYANNA,All right
DAVOS,You never thought youd find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought Id be in my position. I was a crabbers son
LYANNA,Go on
DAVOS,Your uncle
LYANNA,Is this true?JON SNOW nods.
JON SNOW,Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.
DAVOS,As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell
LYANNA,House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1
JON SNOW,Thank you
LYANNA,62.
JON SNOW,62?
LYANNA,We are not a large house
DAVOS,If theyre half as ferocious as their lady
BRYNDEN,Kingslayer.
JAIME,Blackfish.
BRYNDEN,I assume youre here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece. I dont see Sansa and Arya.
JAIME,I dont have them.
BRYNDEN,Pity. Do you wish to resume your captivity?JAIME shakes his head.
BRYNDEN,Then why are you here?
JAIME,You know why Im here. This castle belongs to House Frey. Youre trespassing. In the name of King Tommen
BRYNDEN,Or youll kill Edmure?BRYNDEN walks past JAIME.
BRYNDEN,My nephews marked for death no matter what. Hang him and be done with it.
JAIME,It wont stop with Edmure. Youll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.
BRYNDEN,Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours. If you can breach the walls.JAIME positions himself beside BRYNDEN.
JAIME,Well breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender
BRYNDEN,Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.
JAIME,The war is over
BRYNDEN,As long as Im standing
JAIME,You clearly have no intention of saving your mens lives. Why did you come to treat with me?BRYNDEN turns back to face JAIME.
BRYNDEN,Sieges are dull. And I wanted to see you in person
JAIME,Well
BRYNDEN,Aye
ROBETT,The answer is no.
JON SNOW,Lord Glover
ROBETT,Ive heard enough. Weve only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn. The Boltons helped us do it. Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.
JON SNOW,The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -
ROBETT,Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?
JON SNOW,House Mormont.
ROBETT,And?
JON SNOW,We sent raven to Houses Manderly- -
ROBETT,I dont care about ravens. Youre asking me to join your army. Who is fighting in this army?
JON SNOW,The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.ROBETT laughs.
ROBETT,Then the rumors are true. I didnt dare believe them. I received you out of respect for your father. Now I would like you to leave. House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.ROBETT turns around and heads up the stairs towards a door attended by his men.
JON SNOW,Lord Glover.
ROBETT,Theres nothing else to say.
SANSA,I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark. Sworn to answer when called upon.JON SNOW glares at SANSA. ROBETT turns on his heel and walks up close to SANSA.
ROBETT,Yes
ROBETT,And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him killed.ROBETT looks at JON SNOW and then back at SANSA.
ROBETT,I served House Stark once
EXT. LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BAYMany boats bearing the sigil of House Greyjoy on their sails are docked in the bay near the Long Bridge. Chatter and laughter can be heard from the Long Bridge.CUT TO,LONG BRIDGE OF VOLANTIS - BARMany Ironborn men are communing with prostitutes. THEON sits at a table alone
THEON,Why did we have to come here?
YARA,Some of us still like it. Have a drink at least.
THEON,I dont want one.YARA sighs and turns back to the prostitute..
YARA,Dont go far
YARA,Ill find you in a bit.The prostitute stands. YARA kisses her backside and then slaps it. The prostitute giggles and runs away. YARA laughs and grabs a drink.
YARA,Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that. Doesnt interest you anymore?THEON scrunches up his face.
YARA,Im sorry. I wont joke about it. Ill never hurt you
THEON,You think Uncle Eurons hunting for us?
YARA,Of course he is. As long as were alive
THEON,Hell find us.
YARA,Its a great big world and we have fast ships. Drink.
THEON,I dont want any.
YARA,I dont care what you want. Drink.THEON takes a small sip of his drink.
YARA,Drink it all.THEON drinks deeper.
YARA,Youre Ironborn
THEON,Some bad years?
YARA,But Im tired of watching you cower like a beat dog. Drink the goddamn ale.THEON takes another deep drink.
YARA,Now listen to me. I need you. The real Theon Greyjoy
YARA,You escaped
THEON,If I got justice
YARA,Fuck justice
YARA,Listen to me. If youre so broken that theres no coming back
YARA,Are you with me? Are you really with me?THEON slowly raises his head up and locks eyes with YARA. He nods. YARA smiles and kisses his forehead.
YARA,Now
DAVOS,Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.
SANSA,And thats a good thing?
DAVOS,He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. Theres a stream down there for the horses.
JON SNOW,Were not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..
DAVOS,Aye
JON SNOW,We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.They all dismount their horses and begin walking side by side.
DAVOS,2
SANSA,62 Mormonts.
DAVOS,Its not what wed hoped for. But we still have a chance if were careful and smart.DAVOS spots two men fighting.
DAVOS,For fucks sake.DAVOS hurries over to the men. JON SNOW and SANSA watch him go and then continue walking.
SANSA,So hes your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?
JON SNOW,Ser Davos is the reason Im standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.
SANSA,Stannis who lost the Blackwater
SANSA,Its not enough. We need more men.
JON SNOW,Theres no time.
SANSA,If we went down to Castle Cerwyn
JON SNOW,We fight with the army we have.JON SNOW looks over SANSAs shoulder at DAVOS. He is standing in front of the fighting men
DAVOS,Friends
DAVOS,Thisll be it
MAN,Who the fuck are you?
DAVOS,Hold on.
MAN #2,Yeah
RAY,I was a soldier once. All my superiors thought I was brave. I wasnt. I mean
RAY,That night...I felt such shame. Shame was so heavy on me
RAY,All I could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her sons name. Ill hear her screaming the rest of my life.RAY stands and walks back to the center of the circle.
RAY,Now
RAY,Its never too late to come back.SANDOR returns RAYs gaze but is distracted by three horsemen coming up the way. RAY turns to look at them. SANDOR walks a few paces into the midst of RAYs followers and stares at the riders.
RAY,And its not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers. Its not even about the gods. Its about you. Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.The three riders reach the group and stop. RAY walks out to meet them. All of RAYs followers stand. The riders are FLYNN
RAY,Seven save you
LEM,What are you doing here?
RAY,Well
LEM,Protecting the people.

LEM,Do you have any horses?
RAY,No horses. No gold. No steel.
LEM,Food

LEM,Stay safe. The night is dark and full of terrors.LEM smiles. The three riders turn the horses around and ride off. SANDOR watches them leave.CUT TO: RIVERLANDS - BROTHER RAYS ENCAMPMENT OUTSKIRTSSANDOR is splitting wood with an ax on a chopping block. RAY walks up the path. SANDOR sees him coming but continues chopping.
SANDOR,<93>Seven save you

SANDOR,They dont believe in your Seven. Theyre from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.
RAY,Aye
SANDOR,Sure
RAY,What do you want to do? Fight them? Kill them?SANDOR shrugs and sighs.
RAY,Itd be you against all of them. I mean
SANDOR,You do.
RAY,Im done with fighting.
SANDOR,Even if its to protect yourself?
RAY,Violence is a disease. You dont cure a disease by spreading it to more people.
SANDOR,You dont cure it by dying
RAY,Youve done enough work for one day. Come on up for some supper.RAY starts back up the path.
SANDOR,Its gonna be a cold night. Well need firewood.
RAY,Ill save you a bowl of stew. Might even have some ale hidden away.
MAN,Hes not a lying man. He says the Iron Fleets in Slavers Bay. Im inclined to believe him. Im not going anywhere near those mad fuckers.ARYA walks up beside the men and addressing the one who was speaking.
ARYA,Youre Westerosi.
MAN,What do you care?
ARYA,I want to book passage home.The man laughs.
MAN,You? Cant afford it.ARYA tosses a bag of coins on the table in front of the man. The man opens it and pulls out some coins.
MAN,Whered you steal this from?
ARYA,Why do you care?
MAN,We leave in two days. You can have a hammock in steerage.ARYA throws another bag of coins on the table.
ARYA,I want a cabin. And well leave at dawn.ARYA walks past the man and grabs the coin purses off the table on the way.
ARYA,See you at sunrise.ARYA walks onto a bridge and stops to stare out at the Titan. An old woman approaches her.
WOMAN,Sweet girl.ARYA turns to face the old woman. The old woman draws a blade and slashes ARYA across the stomach. She grabs ARYA by the neck and holds her tight to her body
LADY CRANE,My son. My firstborn son. My child king hush. Listen to the gods for you they sing. Fight no more
ARYA,Youre good at that. Where did you learn?
LADY CRANE,Im a jealous woman. Ive always liked bad men and theyve always liked me. Theyd come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whores perfume.LADY CRANE stands and carries her tray of medical supplies into the abutting room.
LADY CRANE,So wed fight and Id put a hole in them. And then Id feel terrible so Id patch them up. I got good at patching them up.
ARYA,And good at putting holes in them.LADY CRANE chuckles. ARYA smiles.
LADY CRANE,And that.
ARYA,What happened to the actress? The one who wanted you dead.
LADY CRANE,Bianca.LADY CRANE spoons soup into a bowl and carries it back to ARYA.
LADY CRANE,Shell have a hard time finding work as an actress after what I did to her face.LADY CRANE hands ARYA the bowl. ARYA takes it and slurps then scrunches up her face.
ARYA,Mmm.

ARYA,I cant.
LADY CRANE,Why not? Got a feeling youd be good at this sort of work. And besides we need a new actress.

LADY CRANE,Sleep is the only way youll heal. Trust me if my soup didnt kill you nothing will.ARYA takes the glass

If we are steadfast in our love for the Queen and her faithful advisors no man will ever lock us in chains again.TYRION and VARYS enter walking together through the courtyard. TYRION smiles.
TYRION,Id call that a successful gambit.
VARYS,Would you?
TYRION,Look around. The city has come back to life.
VARYS,You made a pact with fanatics.
TYRION,I did and it worked.
VARYS,If you shaved your beard with a straight razor youd say the razor worked. That doesnt mean it wont cut your throat.
TYRION,Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.TYRION and VARYS stop walking and stare out through an archway at the harbor.
TYRION,Im going to miss you.
VARYS,I know.

QYBURN,Your Grace several members of the Faith Militant have been permitted entry to the Red Keep.
CERSEI,Have been permitted? Thats rather a tortured way of putting it.
QYBURN,They demand to see you Your Grace.
CERSEI,Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?QYBURN says nothing.
CERSEI,The king is aware of their presence?
QYBURN,He is Your Grace. Hes currently in his chambers at prayer.CERSEI stands and walks past QYBURN out into the hall. QYBURN bows to her as she passes then follows her out with GREGOR in tow. At the bottom of the steps
LANCEL,Your Grace His Holiness the High Septon wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor.
CERSEI,His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.
LANCEL,Your Grace this is not a request.
CERSEI,It is a request Cousin Lancel. You are asking me for something Im refusing.
LANCEL,The High Septon commands you. Are you sure you want to refuse him?
CERSEI,He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.
LANCEL,He made no such promises. If you refuse to come of your own free will- -
CERSEI,Get out.LANCEL nods at the Faith Militant. Two of them advance with spikes clubs. GREGOR steps in front of CERSEI.
LANCEL,Move aside ser.GREGOR silently stares out from behind his helmet.
LANCEL,Order your man to step aside or there will be violence.
CERSEI,I choose violence.One of the Faith Militant swings his club into GREGORs chestplate. GREGOR is unaffected. The club is stuck in the metal of the armor and the Faith Militant man struggles to wrench it free. He pulls it loose and reels back for another swing but GREGOR takes him by the throat with one hand and lifts him up off the ground. LANCEL and the other Faith Militant regroup in the courtyard. The man in GREGORs grasp gasps and drops his club. GREGOR tosses him out into the courtyard then follows him out. GREGOR kneels over the man
CERSEI,Please tell His High Holiness hes always welcome to visit.CERSEI QYBURN and GREGOR turn to walk back up the steps.
PODRICK,Looks like a siege my lady.
BRIENNE,You have a keen military mind Pod.BRIENNE spots JAIME riding a white horse among his men.
PODRICK,My lady. My lady.Several Lannister soldiers ride towards BRIENNE and PODRICK and then encircle them.
MAN,Who goes there? State your business!
BRIENNE,My name is Brienne of Tarth. Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister Ive come to speak with him. Tell him I have his sword.CUT TO: RIVERRUN - LANNISTER-FREY ENCAMPMENTPODRICK watches Lannister soldiers riding through the encampment. His is choked from behind by an unknown man who reveals himself to be BRONN.
BRONN,Getting a bit old to be a squire arent we?BRONN releases PODRICK. PODRICK coughs. BRONN laughs and slaps PODRICK on the shoulder.
BRONN,Podrick fucking Payne. I thought youd be dead by now.
PODRICK,Not yet.BRONN laughs and motions to a nearby tent.
BRONN,Are they in there?
PODRICK,Mm-hmm.
BRONN,You think theyre fucking?
PODRICK,What? No.
BRONN,Why not? Id fuck her. Youd fuck her wouldnt you?
PODRICK,Im her squire.
BRONN,Oh. Well hed fuck her thats for sure. And shes fuck him
BRONN,You must have shown it to her by now.
PODRICK,Shes training me to fight.
BRONN,Is she? Oh.
PODRICK,An hour in the morning and hour at night. Every day.
BRONN,Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?
PODRICK,Well thats a different sort of fighting.
BRONN,Now thats the truth isnt it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?PODRICK smiles and nods.
BRONN,All right lets start with your footwork.BRONN stands across from PODRICK.
BRONN,Show me your stance.PODRICK postures up.
BRONN,Now listen to me Pod. See how your feet are about a yard apart?PODRICK looks down at his feet. BRONN slaps him across the face.
BRONN,Lesson number one assume everyone wants to hit you. <91>Cause they do Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire. Do it again. Come on
JAIME,I never thought youd find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.
BRIENNE,Why would you assume that?
JAIME,In my experience girls like her dont live very long.
BRIENNE,I dont think you know many girls like her.
JAIME,Well Im proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds.JAIME walks around the room and comes to a stop on BRIENNEs other side. BRIENNE turns to face him.
JAIME,Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffreys murder so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?
BRIENNE,Ive come for the Blackfish.
JAIME,Youre welcome to have him.
BRIENNE,Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.
JAIME,With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?
BRIENNE,The Tully army.
JAIME,Theyre a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels so you can see the conundrum.
BRIENNE,The Tullys are rebels because theyre fighting for their home?
JAIME,Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.
BRIENNE,As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.
JAIME,Exactly.JAIME and BRIENNE stare at each other.
JAIME,We shouldnt argue about politics.
BRIENNE,Youre a knight Ser Jaime. I know there is honor in you. Ive seen it myself.
JAIME,Im a Lannister. Dont ask me to betray my own house.
BRIENNE,I do no such thing. Take Riverrun without bloodshed. Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact.
JAIME,What do you propose?
BRIENNE,Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.
JAIME,Why would he abandon his ancestral home?
BRIENNE,Because youll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.
JAIME,Have you ever met the Blackfish?
BRIENNE,No.
JAIME,Hes even more stubborn than you are.BRIENNE looks down. JAIME walks back around the table to BRIENNEs other side.
JAIME,All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He wont listen but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone elses home.
BRIENNE,I need your word. If I persuade him to abandon the castle youll grant us safe passage north.
JAIME,You have my word. You have until nightfall.BRIENNE nods and undoes her sword belt. She hands Oathkeeper to JAIME. JAIME sighs.
BRIENNE,You gave it to me for a purpose. Ive achieved that purpose.
JAIME,Its yours. It will always be yours.BRIENNE stares into JAIMEs eyes then ties Oathkeeper back on her waist and begins to walk out. JAIME follows her to the entrance of the tent. BRIENNE turns back.
BRIENNE,one last thing Ser Jaime.
JAIME,Yes Lady Brienne?
BRIENNE,Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender and if you attack the castle honor compels me to fight for Sansas kin.
JAIME,Of course it does.
BRIENNE,To fight you.
JAIME,Lets hope it doesnt come to that.BRIENNE and JAIME stare into each others eyes. BRIENNE exits. JAIME watches her go.CUT TO: RIVERRUN - OUTER WALLBRIENNE and PODRICK follow BRYNDEN holding a piece of parchment as he walks along the walls of Riverrun.
BRYNDEN,Ive said no three times already.
BRIENNE,I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.
BRYNDEN,I havent seen her since she was a child. I dont know her signature. I dont know you. And I will not surrender.BRYNDEN turns to one of his soldiers.
BRYNDEN,Double the guards tonight.BRYNDEN looks out at the Lannister/Frey encampment.
BRIENNE,As I have said my name is- -
BRYNDEN,Yes Brienne of Tarth. I know your father. A good man.
BRIENNE,He always spoke highly of you.
BRYNDEN,And if he were here now Id tell him the same Im telling you.BRYNDEN makes his way down a set of steps.
BRYNDEN,If you think Im abandoning my familys seat on the Kingslayers word of honor youre a bloody fool.
BRIENNE,Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.
BRYNDEN,We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can.BRYNDEN BRIENNE and PODRICK emerge into Riverruns main courtyard.
BRIENNE,Hes not my friend.
BRYNDEN,No?BRYNDEN stops and turns back to face BRIENNE.
BRYNDEN,Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle? Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?
BRIENNE,Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die.BRIENNE holds out the piece of parchment to BRYNDEN. BRYNDEN takes it unfolds it
BRYNDEN,Shes exactly like her mother.BRIENNE smiles. BRYNDEN turns back to face her.
BRYNDEN,I dont have enough men to help her take Winterfell.
BRIENNE,You have more than she does.
BRYNDEN,She wants her home back. I understand that. But this is my home. And if Jaime Lannister wants it he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does.BRYNDEN hands the letter back to BRIENNE. She takes it. BRYNDEN walks away.
BRIENNE,Find the maester. We need to get a raven north to Sansa.
PODRICK,What should I write?
BRIENNE,Tell her I failed.
CERSEI,Theres to be a royal announcement?
KEVAN,There is.
CERSEI,Why wasnt I informed?
KEVAN,There is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment.CERSEi starts up the steps but KEVAN blocks her with his arm.
KEVAN,Where are you going?
CERSEI,To stand by my son.
KEVAN,Your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court.CERSEI stares at TOMMEN. TOMMEN looks away. MAESTER PYCELLE whispers to him. CERSEI QYBURN and GREGOR move to one of the nearby balconies. TOMMEN sits on the Iron Throne and addresses the crowd.
TOMMEN,Lords and ladies the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. One collapses so does the other. The Father judges us all. If you break his laws...you will be punished. After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon
TOMMEN,Furthermore after much prayer and reflection the Crown has decided that from this day forward
CROWD,Seven blessings.TOMMEN stands and makes his way out of the hall accompanied by the goldcloaks. CERSEI watches him leave. QYBURN walks up beside CERSEi and whispers to her.QYBURN: Your Grace...that old rumor you told me about. My little birds investigated.
CERSEI,And? Was it just a rumor or something more?
QYBURN,More. Much more.
MISSANDEI,You seem happy.
TYRION,I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago this city was ready to devour itself.TYRION puts down his glass of wine on a table and pours another glass of wine.
TYRION,Now its like a man reborn.
MISSANDEI,I will be happy when our queen returns.
TYRION,Why dont you drink? Why dont either of you ever drink?TYRION pours a third glass of wine.
GREY WORM,Unsullied never drink.
TYRION,Why not?
GREY WORM,Rules.
TYRION,And who made these rules? Your former masters?GREY WORM and MISSANDEI look at each other.
TYRION,Those miserable old shits didnt want you to be human. Have a drink with me.TYRION hands GREY WORM one of the glasses of wine. GREY WORM takes it.
TYRION,And you? Whats your excuse?GREY WORM sniffs his glass of wine and scrunches up his face. TYRION hands MISSANDEI the second glass of wine. She takes it.
MISSANDEI,I have tried wine before. It made me feel funny.
TYRION,Thats how you know its working.TYRION returns to his glass of wine and raises it up.
TYRION,Heres to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.GREY WORM and MISSANDEI raise their glasses.
TYRION,To Daenerys Stormborn Mother of Dragons Breaker of Chains
GREY WORM & MISSANDEI,Long may she reign.GREY WORM and MISSANDEI sip from their glasses. TYRION drinks all of his.
TYRION,Do you like it?
GREY WORM,Tastes like it has turned.TYRION walks to another decanter on the opposite side of the room and pours himself another glass of wine.
TYRION,Yes yes. Fermentation. One day after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...Id like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imps Delight. Only my close friends could drink it.TYRION sips his wine.
TYRION,Tell me a joke Missandei of Naath.TYRION walks back in front of GREY WORM and MISSANDEI.
MISSANDEI,I do not know any jokes.
TYRION,Grey worm?GREY WORM stares and says nothing.
TYRION,Right. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark a Martell and a Lannister. They order ale...MISSANDEI sips her wine.
TYRION,...but when the barkeep brings them over each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister outraged
TYRION,Its funnier in Westeros.
GREY WORM,The Starks and the lannisters i thought these were enemies.
TYRION,Yes.
MISSANDEI,A joke is like a story Torgo Nudho. Not a true story necessarily.
TYRION,A story thats supposed to make you laugh ideally. Not at the moment perhaps.MISSANDEI sips her wine again.
TYRION,Missandei do you like the wine?
MISSANDEI,I do.
TYRION,Tell a joke.
MISSANDEI,Two translators are on a sinking ship.TYRION smiles.
MISSANDEI,The first says <93>Do you know how to swim?<94> The second says <93>No
GREY WORM,That is the worst joke I ever heard.
MISSANDEI,You dont even know what a joke is.
GREY WORM,I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?
TYRION,You lied to us.
GREY WORM,I make joke.MISSANDEI and TYRION laugh. GREY WORM smiles.
MISSANDEI,More jokes.
TYRION,I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says- -Bells begin to ring. GREY WORM stands and runs out of the room shouting in Valyrian.CUT TO: MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINEA fleet of white-sailed ships approaches Meereen. TYRION and MISSANDEI stare at at the ships.
MISSANDEI,The Masters have come for their property.
JAIME,Lord Edmure.EDMUREs hands are behind his back his wrists bound around a vertical pole in the center of the tent. He is kneeling.
JAIME,I apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word youll be properly fed and clothes from now on.EDMURE stands.
EDMURE,I have your word?EDMURE scoffs.
EDMURE,Oh good. Good thats- - thats a fine thing. My uncle will never surrender the castle
JAIME,The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you you have a child now Ive heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. Youre a potent man.
EDMURE,A son Ive never met born of a wife that I havent seen since our first night together.
JAIME,You should be with them both. I can arrange that you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age
EDMURE,Do you imagine yourself a decent person? Is that it? After youve massacred my family. Kept me in a cell for years. Stolen our lands.
JAIME,Ill remind you that our houses are at war. Im sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences.
EDMURE,Says the man who shoved his sword through his kings back.
JAIME,Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? Its not.JAIME sits on a barrel in the corner of the room.
EDMURE,You understand. On some level you understand that youre an evil man.
JAIME,Ill leave the judgments to the gods.
EDMURE,Well that is convenient for you. Youre a fine-looking fellow arent you?EDMURE chuckles.
EDMURE,Your square jaw your golden armor. Tell me I want to know. I truly do. How do you live with yourself? All of us have to believe that were decent
JAIME,I was your sisters prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.EDMURE laughs.
EDMURE,Yeah. She should have killed you.
JAIME,Perhaps but she didnt. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didnt hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son.
EDMURE,Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you dont?
JAIME,No I dont but Im telling you anyway because youre my prisoner. You dont have a choice. The love she had for her children
EDMURE,Oh. Oh I see. Youre a madman.
JAIME,Im not here to trade insults. Your sister was a strong- -
EDMURE,Dont talk about Cat!
JAIME,Ill talk about whomever I want.EDMURE grunts and struggles against his bindings.
JAIME,She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do but Catelyn and Cersei theres a fierceness you dont often see.JAIME stands and walks closer to EDMURE.
JAIME,Theyd do anything to protect their babies.JAIME gets in EDMUREs face.
JAIME,Start a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.
EDMURE,You didnt come here to talk about our sisters.
JAIME,Thats exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesnt matter. She needs me. And to get back to her I have to take Riverrun. Ill send for your baby boy.EDMURE struggles against his bindings pushing himself towards JAIME.
JAIME,And Ill launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you dont matter to me Lord Edmure. Your son doesnt matter to me. The people in the castle dont matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her thats what Ill do.CUT TO: RIVERRUN - OUTER WALLEDMURE crosses the bridge over Riverruns moat
GUARD CAPTAIN,Who goes there?
EDMURE,Edmure Tully son of Hoster Tully and the rightful Lord of Riverrun. I demand entry.BRYNDEN appears on the wall with the guards.
BRYNDEN,Dont let him in.
GUARD CAPTAIN,Hes the Lord of Riverrun. I have to obey his commands.
BRYNDEN,Hes been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding. Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding would decide to let him come home? Because its a trap you idiot. Dont let him in.BRYNDEN turns to walk away.
GUARD CAPTAIN,Hes my lord my lord. Ive sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands.BRYNDEN turns back.
BRYNDEN,Youre not obeying Edmures commands. Youre obeying the fucking Kinglsayers commands.
EDMURE,I demand entry.
GUARD CAPTAIN,My lord has given an order.
BRYNDEN,WIth a knife to his throat. That is not a valid order.The guard captain turns to his fellow guards.
GUARD CAPTAIN,Lower the drawbridge and open the gate for Lord Ed- -BRYNDEN unsheathes his sword halfway. The guard captain and the other guards show their steel.
BRYNDEN,Ill have your head before I surrender Riverrun.
GUARD CAPTAIN,You are not lord of this castle my lord.BRYNDEN looks around at the other guards sheathes his sword
GUARD CAPTAIN,Lower the drawbridge!
GUARD,Aye ser!The drawbridge begins to open. EDMURE stares back across the Lannister/Frey encampment. JAIME waits on his horse. BLACK WALDER rides up beside JAIME. The drawbridge fully extends. EDMURE walks inside.
BLACK WALDER,If youre wrong were just surrendered our most valuable prisoner.The drawbridge closes behind EDMURE. Riverrun soldiers are gathered to meet him. BRYNDEN appears in the rear of their ranks. EDMURE spots BRYNDEN hands his torch to one of the soldiers
GUARD CAPTAIN,Welcome home my lord.
EDMURE,Command all the forces within the castle to lay down their arms. Open the gates.
GUARD CAPTAIN,My lord- -
EDMURE,Your lord has given a command.The drawbridge opens. JAIME glances at BLACK WALDER and rides towards Riverrun. The Lannister and Frey forces follow him into Riverrun.
EDMURE,Find the Blackfish. Put him in irons and hand him over to the Freys.
GUARD CAPTAIN,Find him.The Riverrun soldiers lay down their arms in a pile as the Lannister forces enter the castle.CUT TO: RIVERRUN - RIVER EXITBRYNDEN PODRICK and BRIENNE emerge from a doorway. BRYNDEN places the torch in a sconce and stands in the doorway. PODRICK gets onto a small rowboat floating on the surface of the river. BRIENNE kneels to steady the rowboat for PODRICK
BRYNDEN,Go on.BRYNDEN stands and faces him.
BRIENNE,Come with us.
BRYNDEN,Ive run before from the Red Wedding. Im not running again. This is my family home.
BRIENNE,Your family is in the North. Come with us. Dont die for pride when you can fight for your blood.
BRYNDEN,Youll serve Sansa far better than I ever could.Some guards begin shouting in the background.
BRYNDEN,Go on now.BRYNDEN unsheathes his sword.
BRYNDEN,I havent had a proper sword fight in years. I expect Ill make a damn fool of myself.BRYNDEN heads through the doorway and back up the steps. BRIENNE watches him leave and then gets on the rowboat.CUT TO: RIVERRUN - COURTYARDLannister and Frey banners are being draped all over the courtyard. Lannister soldiers walk over the fallen Tully banners.CUT TO: RIVERRUN - OUTER WALLJAIME stands atop the outer wall. A Lannister guard enters and approaches him.
GUARD,We found the Blackfish my lord.
JAIME,Good. Bring him to me.
GUARD,He died fighting my lord.JAIME nods to the guard. The guard exits. JAIME stares out at the river and sees BRIENNE and PODRICK rowing away from Riverrun. He looks around to see if anyone else is watching. BRIENNE looks over her shoulder and sees JAIME standing atop the wall. JAIME waves to her. BRIENNE waves back.
EXT. MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SHORELINEThe Masters fleet is launching flaming projectiles at Meereen and the Great Pyramid setting them ablaze.CUT TO,MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID CONFERENCE ROOMTYRION and MISSANDEI enter. GREY WORM is waiting for them. Many Unsullied stand guard around the room.
TYRION,I was wrong. I admit it.
MISSANDEI,That changes nothing.
TYRION,The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers forces- -
GREY WORM,No more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.
TYRION,And I have acknowledged that. Im trying- -
GREY WORM,Youre trying to tell me what the army should do. You do not know what the army should do.
TYRION,All right what should the army do?
GREY WORM,Well not go to the beach. If we go to the beach the Masters will take the pyramid. The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend. We stay here.
TYRION,And then?
GREY WORM,We wait for them to come to us. Then we fight them.Something thuds and rattles the roof of the pyramid. Footsteps can be heard. Everyone looks up. MISSANDEI grabs a knife from a table and stands beside TYRION. GREY WORM and the Unsullied form up in front of the door to the balcony. One Unsullied opens the door. Another inches out through it shield and spear in hand. The Unsullied man looks side to side and sees nothing but then sees something and kneels. The rest of the Unsullied follow suit. DAENERYS enters. A dragon screeches and flies away in the background.
BERIC,Clegane.
THOROS,What the fuck you doing here?
SANDOR,Chasing them. You?
THOROS,Hanging them.
SANDOR,Any particular reason?
BERIC,Theyre our men. Or they were. They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers. Why do you want them?
SANDOR,Same reason. I was helping build it. They killed a friend of mine.
THOROS,Youve got friends?
SANDOR,Not anymore. Theyre mine.SANDOR advances. BERIC and another member of the Brotherhood block his path.
BERIC,Its the Brotherhoods good name theyve dragged through the dirt.
SANDOR,Fuck your name. Theyre mine. I killed you once before Dondarrion. Happy to do it again.One of the Brotherhood members notches an arrow and points his bow at SANDOR.
SANDOR,Drop that arrow you bloody girl.SANDOR points his ax at the man but keeps his eyes locked on BERIC.
SANDOR,Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me.SANDOR walks towards the bowman.
BERIC,You can have one of them.SANDOR turns back to face BERIC glances at the men about to be hanged then looks back at BERIC.
SANDOR,Two.BERIC looks at THOROS. THOROS nods. BERIC nods to SANDOR. SANDOR approaches one of the men and raises his ax above his head to swing. THOROS catches the axs handle from behind.
THOROS,No no no.SANDOR turns to face THOROS and tries to wrench his ax free.
THOROS,Were not butchers. We hang them.THOROS releases SANDORs ax.
SANDOR,hanging? All over in an instant. Wheres the punishment in that?
THOROS,They die.
SANDOR,We all bloody die.SANDOR gestures to BERIC.
SANDOR,Except this one here. Ill only gut one of them.
BERIC,No.
SANDOR,Ill chop off one hand.
BERIC,We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss. Thats generous.
SANDOR,Bunch of nancies.SANDOR throws down his ax.
SANDOR,There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.
THOROS,Youre getting old Clegane.
SANDOR,Hes not.SANDOR kicks the box out from underneath one of the men hanging him. He moves in front of LEM.
LEM,Please dont. Ill give you anything.SANDOR kicks the box out from underneath LEM hanging him. LEM gasps for air. BERIC hangs the third man. SANDOR pulls the boot off of LEMs foot. BERIC and THOROS begin to walk away but turn back to look at SANDOR. SANDOR takes off his own boot and sizes up LEMs boot to his own foot. He shoves his foot into LEMs boot and looks up at BERIC and THOROS.
SANDOR,Got anything to eat?CUT TO: RIVERLANDS - BROTHERHOOD WITHOUT BANNERS ENCAMPMENTSeveral members of the Brotherhood are sitting around small campfires. SANDOR BERIC and some other Brothers are sitting at one such campfire. SANDOR is eating a piece of meat. THOROS approaches and sits beside them.
THOROS,Enjoying yourself?SANDOR: I prefer chicken.THOROS hands SANDOR a water skin. SANDOR drinks from it.
BERIC,You ought to join us. We could use you.
SANDOR,I tried joining. Didnt work out for me.
THOROS,Clegane were here for a reason. The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason. He gave a failed drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason. We are part of something larger than ourselves.
SANDOR,Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.SANDOR returns the water skin to THOROS stands walks to the river
BERIC,Cold winds are rising in the North.
SANDOR,And youre going to go stop them?
BERIC,We need good men to help us.
SANDOR,Last time you saw me you wanted to execute me.
BERIC,True enough. But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me. Why?SANDOR laughs.
SANDOR,I beat you because Im better than you Beric. I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and Im better than you now.SANDOR returns to his spot by the campfire and sits.
BERIC,Aye youre probably right. Youre a fighter. You were born a fighter. You walked away from the fight. How did that go? Good and bad young and old
ARYA,Lady Crane?ARYA gets out of bed and winces. She walks towards the abutting room.
ARYA,Lady Crane?ARYA enters the abutting room and sees LADY CRANE lying crumpled on top of the stool dead. Blood is pooled on the ground beneath her.
WAIF,If youd have done your job she would have died painlessly.ARYA turns to see the WAIF standing in the doorway with a knife. The WAIF approaches ARYA slowly and ARYA backs away matching her pace.
WAIF,Instead<85>The WAIF holds out her arms.
WAIF,The Many-Faced God was promised a name. He must always receive what is his. You cant change that. I cant change that. No one can. And now hes been promised another name.ARYA turns around runs out onto the balcony and jumps off. She grunts as her hands and feet connect with the ground. The sprints off through the streets
WAIF,It will all be over soon. On your knees or on your feet?ARYA retrieves Needle from beneath a blanket and stands.
WAIF,Havent we been through this already? That wont help you.The WAIF advances. ARYA holds Needle up in front of her face closes her eyes and cuts the candle in half. The room goes dark.CUT TO: BRAAVOS - HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITEJAQEN enters the main hall. He notices a blood trail on the floor leading to the Hall of Faces. He follows the trail and enters the Hall. The trail leads to one of the columns bearing the faces. The WAIFs bloody face rests in one of the sconces.
ARYA,You told her to kill me.ARYA appears behind JAQEN pointing Needle at him. JAQEN turns to face her.
JAQEN,Yes. But here you are. And there she is.JAQEN pushes his chest against Needles point.
JAQEN,Finally a girl is no one.
ARYA,A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and Im going home.JAQEN smiles. ARYA turns and exits.
TYRION,Despite appearances I think youll find the citys on the rise.An explosion occurs outside.
TYRION,Perhaps we should take shelter.An explosion occurs outside.
DAENERYS,The city is on the rise?
TYRION,Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.An explosion occurs outside.
TYRION,Well not all the people
TYRION,...it proves that no one needs a Master.
DAENERYS,Good. Shall we begin?
TYRION,Do we have a plan?DAENERYS: I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire kill every last one of their soldiers
DAENERYS,You dont approve?
TYRION,You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for Kings Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?An explosion occurs outside.
TYRION,Probably not. Well he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep
DAENERYS,This is entirely different.
TYRION,Youre talking about destroying cities. Its not entirely different. Id like to suggest an alternate approach.A blast causes the window across the room to explode inward sending shards of wood flying everywhere. DAENERYS and TYRION duck
RAZDAL,Once before I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant
TYRION,We are here to discuss terms of surrender not to trade insults.
YEZZAN,The terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.
DAENERYS,We obviously didnt communicate clearly. Were here to discuss your surrender not mine.
RAZDAL,I imagine its difficult adjust to the new reality. Your reign is over.
DAENERYS,My reign has just begun.A dragon screeches in the distance. YEZZAN turns to look in the direction of the screech. DROGON flies up over the plateau and lands on an overlooking structure. He roars and drops down beside DAENERYS. DAENERYS climbs on his back and they fly off over Meereen. When they pass over the entrance to the catacombs RHAEGAL and VISERION bust down the door with flame and take flight to join them. The ensemble flies over the beach entrance to Meereen.CUT TO: MEEREEN - BEACH ENTRANCEA group of the Sons of the Harpy are slaughtering citizens of Meereen. Galloping footsteps can be heard in the distance. One of the Sons of the Harpy turns to look in the direction of the sound. The Dothraki horde led by DAARIO rounds the bend of a nearby cliff
DAENERYS,Dracarys.The dragons shoot stream of fire down at the the ship. The ship becomes engulfed in flame and the soldiers scream as they die. The ship incinerates and capsizes.CUT TO: MEEREEN - PLATEAUGREY WORM steps forward and addresses the Masters soldiers.
GREY WORM,You men have a choice:The Unsullied ready their spears. The Masters soldiers ready their swords.
GREY WORM,...fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you or go home to your families.A dragon screeches in the distance. The Masters soldiers lay down their arms and run away.
TYRION,Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now last time we spoke
MISSANDEI,Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.
TYRION,It always seems a bit abstract doesnt it
RAZDAL,Him. He should die.
BELICHO,Yes him.TYRION looks at GREY WORM.
RAZDAL,Hes not one of us. Hes an outsider a lowborn. He does not speak for us.GREY WORM approaches the YEZZAN and stares in his eyes.
YEZZAN,Please.YEZZAN falls to his knees. GREY WORM unsheathes his dagger and slices RAZDAL and BELICHOs throats. He sheathes his dagger and steps back. TYRION approaches YEZZAN and puts his hand on his shoulder.
TYRION,Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.TYRION pats YEZZAN on the shoulder. He
JON SNOW,You dont have to be here.
SANSA,Yes I do.
RAMSAY,My beloved wife. Ive missed you terribly.RAMSAY looks at JON SNOW.
RAMSAY,Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely. Now dismount and kneel before me
JON SNOW,Youre right. Theres no need for a battle. Thousands of men dont need to die. Only one of us. Lets end this the old way. You against me.RAMSAY chuckles.
RAMSAY,I keep hearing stories about you bastard. The way people in the North talk about you
JON SNOW,Aye you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldnt fight for them?RAMSAY points at JON SNOW.
RAMSAY,Hes good. Very good. Tell me will you let your little brother die because youre too proud to surrender?
SANSA,How do we know you have him?RAMSAY nods to SMALLJON. SMALLJON pulls SHAGGYDOGs head out from a satchel and throws it on the ground.
RAMSAY,Now if you want to save <97>
SANSA,Youre going to die tomorrow Lord Bolton. Sleep well.SANSA turns her horse and rides away.
RAMSAY,Shes a fine woman your sister. I look forward to having her back in my bed. And youre all fine-looking men. My dogs are desperate to meet you. I havent fed them for seven days. Theyre ravenous. I wonder which parts theyll try first. Your eyes? Your balls? Well find out soon enough. In the morning
JON SNOW,If he was smart hed stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.
DAVOS,Thats not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part theyll stop fearing him. He cant have that. Fear is his power.
JON SNOW,Its his weakness too. His mean dont want to fight for him. Theyre forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning...
TORMUND,Its not his men that worry me. Its his horses. I know what mounted knights can do to us.TORMUND looks at DAVOS.
TORMUND,You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.
JON SNOW,Were digging trenches all along our flanks. They wont be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you in a double envelopment.
JON SNOW,A pincer move.TORMUND stares blankly at JON SNOW. JON SNOW and DAVOS look at each other briefly.
JON SNOW,They wont be able to hit us from the sides.
TORMUND,Good.
DAVOS,Its crucial that we let them charge at us. Theyve got the numbers we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center
TORMUND,Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?
JON SNOW,No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.
DAVOS,We should all get some sleep.
TORMUND,Rest Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow.DAVOS
SANSA,So youve met the enemy drawn up your battle plans.
JON SNOW,Aye for what theyre worth.
SANSA,Youve known him for the space of a single conversation you and your trusted advisors
JON SNOW,Youre right.
SANSA,You think hes going to fall into your trap. He wont Hes the one who lays traps.
JON SNOW,Hes overconfident.
SANSA,He plays with people. Hes far better at it than you. Hes been doing it all his life.JON SNOW stands.
JON SNOW,Aye and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. Ive defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton.
SANSA,You dont know him.
JON SNOW,All right tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?
SANSA,Well never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you
JON SNOW,We cant give up on our brother.
SANSA,Listen to me please. He wants you to make a mistake.
JON SNOW,Of course he does. What should I do differently?
SANSA,I dont know! I dont know anything about battles! Just dont do what he wants you to do.
JON SNOW,Aye thats good advice.
SANSA,You think thats obvious?
JON SNOW,Well it is a bit obvious.
SANSA,If you had asked for my advice earlier I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force
JON SNOW,When will we have a larger force?! Weve pleaded with every house thatll have us! The Blackfish cant help us! Were lucky to have this many men!
SANSA,Its not enough!
JON SNOW,Now its not enough! Its what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds.
SANSA,If Ramsay wins Im not going back there alive. Do you understand me?
SANSA,No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.SANSA exits. JON SNOW turns looks at the table
DAVOS,You think theres hope?
TORMUND,Ive never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And theyve never seen the free folk fight so
DAVOS,It wasnt the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.
TORMUND,You saw these demons?
DAVOS,What?They stop walking. DAVOS looks at TORMUND.
DAVOS,No its a manner of speaking. Not actual demons.
TORMUND,Oh. Well you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didnt have demons in his skull. He didnt torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him. I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night. But I was wrong just like you.
DAVOS,Maybe that was our mistake believing in kings.
TORMUND,Jon Snows not a king.
DAVOS,No hes not.TORMUND and DAVOS smile at each other.
TORMUND,I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goats milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.
DAVOS,No thanks. It does sound delicious
TORMUND,So what do you do all night?
DAVOS,I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until Im far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.TORMUND laughs.
TORMUND,Happy shitting.TORMUND walks away.CUT TO: STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRES TENTMELISANDRE is sitting at a desk with a mirror and candles on it staring into a fire pit. JON SNOW enters and approaches her.
JON SNOW,My lady. You werent at the war council.
MELISANDRE,Im not a soldier.
JON SNOW,Any advice?
MELISANDRE,Dont lose.
JON SNOW,If I do if I fall
MELISANDRE,Ill have to try.
JON SNOW,Im ordering you not to bring me back.
MELISANDRE,I am not your servant Jon Snow.
JON SNOW,Youre in my camp. Im the commander.
MELISANDRE,I serve the Lord of Light. I do what he commands.
JON SNOW,How do you know what he commands?
MELISANDRE,I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didnt want me to bring you back how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you.
JON SNOW,Why?
MELISANDRE,I dont know. Maybe youre only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.
JON SNOW,What kind of god would do something like that?
MELISANDRE,The one weve got.JON SNOW stares into the fire pit and then exits.CUT TO: STARK ENCAMPMENT - OUTSKIRTSDAVOS is walking alone through the snow. He happens upon a pile of wooden rubble and stops to inspect it. He sees a charred statuette of a stag in the wood and stops to pick it up. He looks back at the pile of wood. A horn blows in the distance. DAVOS looks in the direction of the horn then hands his head.
TYRION,Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell yes? You were making jokes about my height
THEON,It was a long time ago.
TYRION,It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well I gather. Cant imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well.
THEON,I didnt murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.
YARA,And he paid for them.
TYRION,Doesnt seem like it. Hes still alive. It was complicated for you Im sure
DAENERYS,Youve brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?
THEON,Not my claim. Hers.
DAENERYS,And whats wrong with you?
THEON,Im not fit to rule.
TYRION,We can agree upon that at least.
DAENERYS,Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?
YARA,No more than Westeros.DAENERYS smiles.
THEON,Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara. He would have murdered us if we had stayed.
DAENERYS,Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.
YARA,You and I have that in common.
DAENERYS,We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well.DAENERYS turns to TYRION.
DAENERYS,Will their ships be enough?
TYRION,With the former Masters fleet possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.
THEON,There are and Euron is building more. Hes going to offer them to you.
DAENERYS,So why shouldnt I wait for him?
THEON,The Iron Fleet isnt all hes bringing. He also wants to give you --
YARA,His big cock I think he said. Eurons offer is also an offer of marriage
DAENERYS,And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?
YARA,I never demand but Im up for anything
THEON,He murdered our father and would have murdered us. Hell murder you as soon as you have what he wants.
TYRION,The Seven Kingdoms.
THEON,All of them.
DAENERYS,And you dont want the Seven Kingdoms?
THEON,Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you to give them back.
DAENERYS,And thats all?
YARA,Wed like you to help us murder an uncle or two who dont think a womans fit to rule.
DAENERYS,Reasonable.
TYRION,What if everyone starts demanding their independence?
DAENERYS,Shes not demanding shes asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men
DAENERYS,You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving roving
YARA,Thats our way of life.
DAENERYS,No more.YARA and THEON look at each other. THEON nods. YARA turns back to DAENERYS.
YARA,No more.YARA extends her hand to DAENERYS. DAENERYS looks back at TYRION. TYRION makes a shaking motion with his hand. DAENERYS and YARA grab each others arms.
RAMSAY,Do you like games little man? Lets play a game. Run to your brother. The sooner you make it to him
RAMSAY,No you have to run
TORMUND,Dont.RAMSAY smiles and gives his bow back to the soldier.
DAVOS,Prepare to charge! Prepare to charge!The Bolton archers draw and loose a volley of arrows. JON SNOW ushers his horse into a gallop straight towards the Bolton army.
DAVOS,Go! Go! Follow your commander!
TORMUND,Run and fight!WUN WUN roars. The bulk of the Stark forces charge across the field towards the Boltons. JON SNOW continues to rush the Bolton forces alone. The Bolton arches released a volley of arrows some of which land in the body of JON SNOWs horse
RAMSAY,Now.
KARSTARK,Cavalry charge!JON SNOW stands to face the Bolton cavalry
DAVOS,Well just kill our own men. Stand down.The Stark arches do not fire.
RAMSAY,Loose!The Bolton archers fire. Their arrows rain down on Stark and Bolton men alike. In the fray JON SNOW dodges several horses which gallop past him. One Bolton cavalryman charges with his horse
JON SNOW,Get word --The Stark footsoldier is taken in the head by an arrow. JON SNOW stares down at the man and then flies into a rage killing two more Bolton soldiers. A third man runs at him but is knocked down by a galloping horse. JON SNOW runs over to where he landed and stabs him several times. A horseman gallops at JON SNOW with his ax ready
DAVOS,We may as well be taking shits back here.DAVOS dismounts his horse.
DAVOS,Follow!DAVOS unsheathes his sword and charges across the field. The remainder of the Stark forces charge after him. On the other side of the battlefield RAMSAY smiles and acknowledges SMALLJON.
RAMSAY,Its time go.SMALLJON brandishes his sword and walks back and forth in front of his men.
SMALLJON,Who owns the North?
ALL,We do!
SMALLJON,Who owns the North?
ALL,We do!
SMALLJON,Show me!SMALLJON and his men cheer and charge across the battlefield. JON SNOW continues fighting but is knocked to the ground by a Bolton footsoldier. TORMUND appears and stabs the footsoldier through the back
TORMUND,Hey!WUN WUN and the Wildlings charge up behind TORMUND and JON SNOW. SMALLJON and his men are charging from the other side. WUN WUN points at them and grunts. A force of Bolton men appear bearing tall shields and spears. They create a half-circle around JON SNOW TORMUND
MAN,Infantry advance!The shield soldiers grunt in unison
DAVOS,With me lads! Break their line!WUN WUN rushes the shield wall and swipes at the spears. TORMUND jumps to the side of some spears and attacks a man behind the shield wall. Several other Stark men rush towards the shield wall. JON SNOW and other Stark soldiers defend against SMALLJONs men. Many soldiers die on both sides
MAN,Tormund!
MAN #2,Get him back!The shieldbearers advance pushing the Stark forces further in on themselves. More Stark men die.
TORMUND,Fuck this come on!TORMUND leads the Wildlings back towards the piles of bodies. JON SNOW and SMALLJON spot each other
RAMSAY,Their armys gone.
MAN,Our armys gone.
RAMSAY,We have Winterfell. They dont have the men for a siege. All we have to do is wait.Something thuds against the gate. RAMSAY turns to look at it. Several Bolton archers nock arrows. Several more thuds occur against the other side of the gate. WUN WUN busts a hole in the gate. BOLTON archers shoot arrows at his hand and down at his body over the side of the castle wall. WUN WUN roars and punches another hole in the gate. RAMSAY moves farther away from the gates interior. WUN WUN reaches in and grabs the wooden bar holding the gate but a Bolton soldier throws a spear through the back of his hand. WUN WUN rips his hand away and then bursts through the gate
RAMSAY,You suggested one on one combat didnt you?Stark archers aim their bows at RAMSAY.
RAMSAY,Ive reconsidered. I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.RAMSAY notches an arrow. JON SNOW drops his sword and picks up a shield. RAMSAY aims at JON SNOW and fires. JON SNOW raises his shield and blocks the arrow. JON SNOW advances. RAMSAY nocks another arrow and fires. JON SNOW raises his shield and blocks the arrow. JON SNOW advances. RAMSAY nocks a third arrow and fires. JON SNOW raises his shield and blocks the arrow. JON SNOW advances. Before RAMSAY can nock a fourth arrow JON SNOW overtakes him. JON SNOW bashes RAMSAY with his shield twice
JON SNOW,Were going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.The stretcher men continue on. JON SNOW turns to walk away.
SANSA,Jon.JON SNOW turns back to face SANSA.
SANSA,Where is he?CUT TO: WINTERFELL - KENNELSRAMSAY is tied to a chair inside the kennel gates. He is mangled and bleeding. He groans and coughs then raises his head to see SANSA standing outside the gate.
RAMSAY,Ah. Sansa. Hello Sansa. Is this where Ill be staying now? No. Our time together is about to come to an end. Thats all right. You cant kill me. Im part of you now.
SANSA,Your words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear.The dogs growl in their cells and begin filtering out into the kennel.
RAMSAY,My hounds will never harm me.
SANSA,You havent fed them in seven days. You said it yourself.
RAMSAY,Theyre loyal beasts.
SANSA,They were. Now theyre starving.The dogs growl. One approaches RAMSAY from the front and puts its front paws up on his legs. It sniffs RAMSAYs face.
RAMSAY,Sit. Down! Down! Down! Down! Down!The dog bites RAMSAYs face. RAMSAY screams. The dogs converge on RAMSAY and begin tearing him apart. SANSA turns as though she might leave but lingers for a moment to watch. SANSA turns and walks away

MISTRESS,You got my money?
PYCELLE,Later. Go away.The mistress stands and leaves. PYCELLE straightens himself out sighs and exits the room. In the hallway he walks down a set of steps. A young girl appears on the steps behind him.

He bends down and she whispers into his ear.CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELORLANCEL and a group of Faith Militant usher LORAS into the sept and down the steps. His hair has been shorn. MARGAERY stares at him. The Faith Militant lead him to the center of the room and move away. The HIGH SPARROW stands.
HIGH SPARROW,Ser Loras Tyrell. Are you prepared to stand trial and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?
LORAS,Therell be no need for a trial. I confess before the Seven and freely admit to my crimes.
HIGH SPARROW,To which crimes will you be confessing?
LORAS,All of them. I lay with other men including the traitor Renly Baratheon.The crowd murmurs.
LORAS,I perjured myself before the gods. I am guilty of depravity<85> dishonesty profligacy and arrogance. I see that now. I humble myself before the Seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just.
HIGH SPARROW,The gods judgment is fierce but also fair. The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice. But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her.LORAS kneels.
LORAS,I take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires. My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven. May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness.
HIGH SPARROW,You understand fully what this means?
LORAS,I do. I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it. I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden. I will never marry and I will never father children.
HIGH SPARROW,Brother Loras<85>LORAS begins to cry.
HIGH SPARROW,...I ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods.The HIGH SPARROW touches LORAS face. LORAS looks up at him.

MARGAERY,Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here. Why do you think they are not here?
HIGH SPARROW,If the accused is not here she will be tried regardless. We cannot escape the justice of the gods--
MARGAERY,Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what Im telling you. Cersei understands the consequences of her absence and she is absent anyway which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences. The trial can wait. We all need to leave.The HIGH SPARROW scoffs and shakes his head.CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR - TUNNELSLANCEL has almost reached the end of the tunnel. He sees green pools of liquid on the ground in front of two barrels with candles in their centers. The candles have almost burned down to nothing. He looks around at the casks lining the walls of the tunnel and pulls himself onward towards the candles.CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR
MARGAERY,We all need to leave now!MARGAERY hurries over to LORAS. The crowd begins to stir. MARGAERY takes LORAS chin and lifts his face so his eyes meet hers.

The explosion travels down the tunnel igniting all of the barrels.CUT TO: GREAT SEPT OF BAELORThe sound of an explosion can be heard. The green flame erupts from the center of the sept incinerating the HIGH SPARROW and then engulfing the entire sept killing everyone inside. The sept crumbles from the force of the explosion.

CERSEI,Confess. Confess.CERSEI raises a pitcher of wine over SEPTA UNELLAs head.
SEPTA UNELLA,No.
CERSEI,Confess.CERSEI pours the pitcher into SEPTA UNELLAs face. SEPTA UNELLA sputters and struggles. When the pitcher is empty SEPTA UNELLA gasps for air.
CERSEI,Confess. It felt good. Beating me starving me frightening me humiliating me. You didnt do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother<85> because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow<85> and all his little sparrows<85> all his septons all his septas
CERSEI,Youve always been quiet.CERSEI walks around the table.
CERSEI,I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died. Do you remember?

WALDER,And when we drive our swords through our enemies hearts may we speak the words of our alliance <93>The Freys and the Lannisters send their regards.<94>The men cheer. A handmaiden looks at BRONN and then at JAIME.
BRONN,You dont even have to do anything do you?JAIME looks at the handmaiden.
BRONN,You just sit there a rich slab of beef and all the birds come pecking.
JAIME,Youre welcome to her.
BRONN,She doesnt want me. She wants your golden fingers up her twat.JAIME nods at two women standing on the other side of the room.
JAIME,Those two have their eyes on you.BRONN looks at the women.
BRONN,They have their eyes on you cunt.

JAIME,Ladies have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay.JAIME looks at BRONN.
JAIME,There you go.
BRONN,Maybe Im not in the mood.The girls approach Bronn.
BRONN,Fuck it.BRONN stands and approaches the girls.
BRONN,No need to call me ser just because Im an anointed knight.WALDER sits down next to JAIME.
WALDER,This came together rather well. Your father would be pleased.
JAIME,Im sure he would be.
WALDER,Edmure is back in a cell. Cant go killing my son by law. It wouldnt be right. Give the family a bad name.WALDER sips his wine.
WALDER,So the famous Blackfish killed by footsoldiers eh? Legendary warrior everyone said.
JAIME,Have you done much fighting yourself Lord Frey?
WALDER,Im a bit old for all that.
JAIME,No but back in your day.
WALDER,The purpose of fighting is defeating your enemies isnt it?JAIME nods.
WALDER,Ive defeated mine. Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years. Now its mine. What do you call that? Victory.
JAIME,Yes youre a great conqueror.
WALDER,Go on mock me boy. You think I mind? The Tullys mocked me for years. The Starks mocked me. Where are they now? You talk about war as if youre an expert but the one battle I remember you fighting you were captured by Robb Stark the Young Wolf. But it doesnt matter. Here we are now
JAIME,They dont fear the Freys though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them why do we need you?JAIME stands and exits. WALDER watches him go.INT. RED KEEP - QYBURNS LABCERSEI and QYBURN are standing over TOMMENs body. His body is covered in a veil.
CERSEI,Show me.
QYBURN,Your Grace theres no need--
CERSEI,Show me.QYBURN uncovers TOMMENs body. CERSEI stares at it.
QYBURN,What are your thoughts concerning the kings funeral? As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?
CERSEI,He should be with his grandfather his brother his sister. Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood.

Oldtown stands across the lake. SAM and GILLY marvel at it.CUT TO,THE CITADELSAM and GILLY enter and walk to the front desk. A maester is sitting behind the desk holding spectacles up to his eyes and reading.
SAM,Hello.The maester keeps reading and then looks up at SAM removing his spectacles.
SAM,From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.SAM holds up a letter. The maester puts down his spectacles and opens his palm. SAM reaches across the table with the letter offering it to the maester. The maester does not retrieve it. SAM presses himself against the desk leans further in and places the letter directly in the maesters hand. The maester takes the letter breaks the seal
SAM,Im-- Im to be the new maester.The maester looks at SAM and then opens a large book. He flips a few pages.
MAESTER,Oh.The maester points his finger to a line of text on the open page.
MAESTER,According to our records Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.
SAM,He died.
MAESTER,We received no report from the maester at Castle Black.
SAM,Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election. Hes since passed away. Which is why Im here.
MAESTER,This is irregular.
SAM,Yes well I suppose that life is irregular.The maester stares blankly at SAM then picks up a quill and crosses off two lines of text in the open book.
MAESTER,The archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you. In the meantime you are permitted to use the library. Follow me.The maester stands and begins walking away. SAM and GILLY start to follow him. He turns back and looks at GILLY.
MAESTER,No women or children!The maester turns and walks away. SAM makes several baffled gestures to GILLY and then follows the maester. They enter a small hallway full of books. The maester stops in front of a dark side passage and gestures towards it. SAM starts down the passage. The maester leaves. On his way through SAM touches several of the books lining the shelves. SAM emerges onto the other side of the passage. The passage opens onto an enormous library with a chandelier dangling from the ceiling that reflects light. SAM gets teary and smiles.

MELISANDRE,Could have been worse Jon Snow. You had a family. You had feasts.JON SNOW chuckles.
JON SNOW,Aye youre right. I was luckier than most.DAVOS enters the hall and tosses the charred stag statuette at MELISANDRE. MELISANDRE catches it.
JON SNOW,What is that?
DAVOS,Tell him. Tell him who it belonged to.
MELISANDRE,The Princess Shireen.
DAVOS,Tell him what you did to her. Tell him!
MELISANDRE,We burned her at the stake.
DAVOS,Why?
MELISANDRE,The army was trapped. The horses were dying. It was the only way.
DAVOS,You burned a little girl alive!
MELISANDRE,I only do what my Lord commands!
DAVOS,If he commands you to burn children your Lord is evil!
MELISANDRE,We are standing here because of him. Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.
DAVOS,I loved that girl like she was my own. She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!
MELISANDRE,So did her father. So did her mother. Her own blood knew it was the only way.
DAVOS,The only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one. You had him believing it all of them fooled. And you lied.
MELISANDRE,I didnt lie. I was wrong.
DAVOS,Aye you were wrong. How many died because you were wrong?DAVOS and MELISANDRE stare at each other in silence.
DAVOS,I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder. She admits to the crime.
JON SNOW,Do you have anything to say for yourself?
MELISANDRE,Ive been ready to die for many years. If the Lord was done with me so be it but hes not. Youve seen the Night King Jon Snow. You know the great war is still to come. You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon. And you know I can help you win that war.JON SNOW approaches MELISANDRE.

JON SNOW,Im having the lords chamber prepared for you.
SANSA,Mother and Fathers room? You should take it.
JON SNOW,Im not a Stark.
SANSA,You are to me.
JON SNOW,Youre the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. Were standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.
SANSA,He did.
JON SNOW,And you trust him?
SANSA,Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him about the Knights of the Vale. Im sorry.JON SNOW approaches SANSA.
JON SNOW,We need to trust each other. We cant fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.JON SNOW touches SANSAs face and kisses her on the forehead then turns to walk away.
SANSA,Jon.JON SNOW turns back to face SANSA.
SANSA,A raven came from the Citadel. A white raven. Winter is here.JON SNOW smiles and looks up at the sky.
JON SNOW,Well Father always promised didnt he?JON SNOW exits. SANSA looks out at the wilderness.
OLENNA,The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne he was assassinated. 100 red scorpions was it?
ELLARIA,You have nothing to fear from us Lady Olenna.
OLENNA,You murder your own prince but you expect me to trust you?
OBARA,We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help. You came to Dorne because you needed our help?
OLENNA,What is your name again? Barbaro?
OBARA,Obara.
OLENNA,Obara. You look like an angry little boy. Dont presume to tell me what I need.
NYMERIA,Forgive my sister. What she lacks in diplomacy she makes--
OLENNA,Do shut up dear.OLEN looks at TYENE.
OLENNA,Anything from you?TYENE opens her mouth to speak.
OLENNA,No? Good. Let the grown women speak.
ELLARIA,The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell. They have declared war on Dorne. We must be allies now if we wish to survive.
OLENNA,Cersei stole the future from me. She killed my son. She killed my grandson. She killed my granddaughter. Survival is not what Im after now.
ELLARIA,Youre absolutely right. I chose the wrong words. It is not survival I offer. It is your hearts desire.ELLARIA rings a bell.
OLENNA,And what is my hearts desire?
ELLARIA,Vengeance. Justice.VARYS emerges from a hallway.
VARYS,Fire and blood.
DAARIO,Your ships are nearly ready. I saw them painting the sails.DAARIO pours himself a glass of wine.
DAARIO,Im curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water.
DAENERYS,Youre not coming with us.
DAARIO,New strategy? You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast? If we take Casterly Rock the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit Kings Landing.DAARIO approaches DAENERYS and stands in front of her.
DAENERYS,Youre not going to Westeros. Youre staying here with the Second Sons. Theres finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.DAARIO sets his glass of wine down on a table.
DAARIO,Fuck Meereen. Fuck the people. Im here for you not them.
DAENERYS,You promised me. <93>My sword is yours. My life is yours.<94> This is what I command. If Im going to rule in Westeros Ill need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage.DAARIO sits down.
DAARIO,Who are you marrying this time?
DAENERYS,I dont know. Maybe no one.
DAARIO,But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table? Are you a queen or fish bait?
DAENERYS,I cant bring a lover to Westeros.
DAARIO,A king wouldnt think twice about it.
DAENERYS,So thats what you want? To be my mistress?
DAARIO,Im not proud. I dont care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room. I dont want a crown. I want you.DAARIO approaches DAENERYS and kneels in front of her.
DAARIO,I love you. And I make you happy. You know I do. Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.DAENERYS touches DAARIOs face.
DAENERYS,I cant.DAARIO stands.
DAARIO,The dwarf told you to do this.
DAENERYS,No one tells me to do anything.
DAARIO,Clever fellow. Cant argue with his logic. Im no use to you over there.
DAENERYS,Dont get angry.
DAARIO,Im not angry. Im full of self-pity. Who comes after you? Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn the Mother of Dragons?
DAENERYS,A great number of women I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons.DAENERYS stands.
DAARIO,Bay of Dragons?
DAENERYS,We cant call it Slavers Bay anymore can we?
DAARIO,Youll get that throne you want so badly Im sure of it. I hope it brings you happiness.DAARIO sips his wine.
DAARIO,I pity the lord of Westeros. They have no idea whats coming for them.
DAENERYS,Farewell Daario Naharis.DAARIO nods and exits.CUT TO: MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID THRONE ROOMTYRION is sitting off to the side of the room on a bench. DAENERYS enters walking down the steps from the throne.
TYRION,How did he take it?
DAENERYS,No tears.
TYRION,I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. Thats the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler if its any consolation.DAENERYS reaches the bottom of the steps and approaches TYRION.
DAENERYS,Its not.
TYRION,No I suppose not. Im terrible at consoling.DAENERYS sits down on the bench next to TYRION.
DAENERYS,Yes you really are.
TYRION,All right how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies you have your ships you have your dragons. Everything youve ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. Its all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?DAENERYS nods.
TYRION,Good. Youre in the great game now. And the great games terrifying. The only people who arent afraid of failure are madmen like your father.
DAENERYS,Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it.
TYRION,He wasnt the first to love you and he wont be the last.
DAENERYS,Well you have completely failed to console me.DAENERYS stands and turns to face TYRION.
TYRION,For what its worth Ive been a cynic for as long as I can remember. Everyones always asking me to believe in things-- family gods kings myself. It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people. So I said no
TYRION,I believe in you. Its embarrassing really. Id swear you my sword but I dont actually own a sword.
DAENERYS,Its your counsel I need.
TYRION,Its yours. Now and always.
DAENERYS,Good. I um<85> I had something made for you. Im not sure if its right.DAENERYS pins a Hand of the Kings brooch on TYRIONs chest.
DAENERYS,Tyrion Lannister I name you Hand of the Queen.TYRION holds back tears then kneels.
WALDER,Youre not one of mine are you?
HANDMAIDEN,No my lord.
WALDER,Didnt think so. Too pretty.WALDER slaps the handmaiden on the buttocks and smiles.
WALDER,Where are my damn moron sons? Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.
HANDMAIDEN,Theyre here my lord.
WALDER,Well what are they doing trimming their cunt hairs? Tell them to come here now.HANDMAIDEN: But theyre already here my lord.WALDER looks around the hall. The handmaiden points to the pie.
HANDMAIDEN,Here my lord.WALDER pulls back the top layer of the pie. A finger protrudes from the center of the slice.
HANDMAIDEN,They werent easy to carve. Especially Black Walder.WALDER breathes heavily.
WALDER,What<85>The handmaiden reaches up to her face and pulls it away revealing her true identity is ARYA.ARYA: My name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that. The last thing youre ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.ARYA brandishes a knife. WALDER gets up to run but ARYA grabs him and pulls him back down. She grabs him by the forehead and slits his throat. He convulses and groans as he dies. ARYA smiles and stares at him.
PETYR,Forgive me my lady<85> if youre at prayer.
SANSA,Im done with all that. I came here every day when I was a girl. I prayed to be somewhere else. Back then I only ever thought about what I wanted never about what I had.SANSA stands and walks towards PETYR.
SANSA,I was a stupid girl.
PETYR,You were a child.
SANSA,What do you want?
PETYR,I thought you knew what I wanted.
SANSA,I was wrong.
PETYR,No you werent. Every time Im faced with a decision I close my eyes and see the same picture. Whenever I consider an action I ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality? Pull it out of my mind and into the world? And I only act if the answer is yes. A picture of me on the Iron Throne<85> and you by my side.PETYR leans in to kiss SANSA but SANSA puts her hand on his chest to stop him.
SANSA,Its a pretty picture.SANSA walks past PETYR.
PETYR,News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms. Ive declared for House Stark for all to hear.
SANSA,Youve declared for other houses before Lord Baelish. Its never stopped you from serving yourself.
PETYR,The past is gone for good. You can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future. You my love are the future of House Stark. Who should the North rally behind? A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south?SANSA exits.
BENJEN,This is where I leave you.
MEERA,Youre not coming with us?
BENJEN,The Wall is not just ice and stone. Ancient spells were carved into its foundations. Strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond. And while it stands the dead cannot pass. I cannot pass.BENJEN approaches his horse and lifts BRAN off of it. He carries BRAN to the foot of a nearby weirwood then walks back to his horse.
MEERA,Where will you go?
BENJEN,The great war is coming and I still fight for the living. Ill do what I can<85> as long as I can.BENJEN mounts his horse.
BRAN,Thank you Uncle Benjen.
BENJEN,I wish you both good fortune.BENJEN rides away. BRAN looks at the weirwood and then starts to crawl towards it. MEERA helps him. BRAN reaches out to the weirwood but MEERA grabs his wrist.
MEERA,Are you sure youre ready for this?
LYANNA,Ned?
NED,Lyanna.NED rushes to LYANs side.
LYANNA,Is that you? Is that really you?LYAN lifts her hand. NED takes it.
LYANNA,Youre not a dream.
NED,No Im not a dream. Im here. Right here.
LYANNA,Ive missed you big brother.NED begins to cry.
NED,Ive missed you too.
LYANNA,I want to be brave.
NED,Shh. You are.
LYANNA,Im not.NED lifts his hand from LYANs stomach. His palm is covered in blood.
LYANNA,I dont want to die.
NED,Youre not going to die.NED looks at the handmaiden.
NED,Get her some water!
LYANNA,No no water.
NED,Is there a maester?
LYANNA,Please. Listen to me Ned.LYAN whispers in NEDs ear.LYAN: If Robert finds out hell kill him you know he will. You have to protect him. Promise me Ned. Promise me.The handmaiden hands NED the child.
LYANNA,Promise me Ned. Promise me.NED stares down at the baby. The baby opens its eyes. Zoom on the babys face.
VALE KNIGHT,You cant expect Knights of the Vale to side with wildling invaders.
TORMUND,We didnt invade. We were invited.
VALE KNIGHT,Not by me.JON SNOW stands.
JON SNOW,The free folk the northerners and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely fought together and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield.One of the houses representatives stands.
MAN,The Boltons are defeated. The war is over. Winter has come. If the maesters are right itll be the coldest one in a thousand years. We should ride home and wait out the coming storms.
JON SNOW,The war is not over. And I promise you friend the true enemy wont wait out the storm. He brings the storm.The men begin to murmur. LYAN MORMONT stands.
LYANNA,Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding Lord Manderly. But you refused the call. You swore allegiance to House Stark Lord Glover but in their hour of greatest need you refused the call. And you
MANDERLY,Lady Mormont speaks harshly and truly. My son died for Robb Stark the Young Wolf. I didnt think wed find another king in my lifetime. I didnt commit my men to your cause <91>cause I didnt want more Manderlys dying for nothing. But I was wrong. Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding. He is the White Wolf. The King in the North.MANDERLY draws his blade then rests it point-down on the ground and kneels. LORD GLOVER stands.
GLOVER,I did not fight beside you on the field and I will regret that until my dying day. A man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness.
JON SNOW,Theres nothing to forgive my lord.
GLOVER,There will be more fights to come. House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousands years. And I will stand behind Jon Snow<85> the King in the North!GLOVER draws his blade then rests it point-down on the ground and kneels.
GLOVER,The King in the North!Everyone in the hall stands and draws their blades.

WALDER FREY,I've gathered every Frey who means a damn thing so I can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come. But first
WALDERY FREY,Stand together!The Freys stand in unison.
ALL,Stand together!The Freys drink. WALDER holds his cup to his lips but does not drink. The servant girl picks up her cup and motions to drink.
WALDER,Not you. I'm not wasting good wine on a damn woman.WALDER addresses the hall again.
WALDER,Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man. I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot. You're my family
WALDER,Yes
WALDER,No
WALDER,Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe.The Freys collapse and die. WALDER takes hold of his own face and removes it

MEERA,I'm Meera Reed
EDD,How do I know that's true?BRAN raises his head and stares at EDD.
BRAN,You were at the Fist of the First Men. You were at Hardhome. You've seen the Army of the Dead. You've seen the Night King. He's coming for us. For all of us.EDD pauses and looks down
EDD,Okay
JON,I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it
ROBETT,It's about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight.The northern lords laugh.
JON,Not just the boys.BRIENNE looks at JON.
JON,We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting.ROBETT stands.
ROBETT,You expect me to put a spear in my granddaughter's hand?LYAN stands.
LYANNA,I don't plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me. I might be small
ROBETT,Indeed you are
LYANNA,And I don't need your permission to defend the North.DAVOS smiles. LYAN turns to JON.
LYANNA,We'll begin training every man
JON,While we're preparing for attack
JON,But if we're going to survive this winter together...TORMUND grunts and stands.
TORMUND,You want us to man the castles for you?The men murmur.
JON,Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
TORMUND,Then that's where I'll go. Looks like we're the Night's Watch now.TORMUND sits.
JON,If they breach the wall
YOHN,The Umbers and the Karstarks betrayed the North. Their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing.
SANSA,The castles committed no crimes. And we need every fortress we have for the war to come. We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families
ALL,Aye!YOHN sits.
JON,The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation.
SANSA,And then they broke faith.
JON,I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.
SANSA,So there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?The hall goes silent.
JON,The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.
SANSA,They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you.The men chatter and pound the tables.
JON,When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said
SANSA,What does she want?
JON,Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.
SANSA,You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north
JON,I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me
SANSA,We still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.
JON,There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.SANSA: You're the military man
JON,You almost sound as if you admire her.
SANSA,I learned a great deal from her.
JAIME,What is this?
CERSEI,Its what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for
JAIME,He knew it. Made me memorize every damn city
CERSEI,It's ours now
CERSEI,You've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?
JAIME,No
CERSEI,Are you afraid of me?
JAIME,Should I be?
CERSEI,Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now
JAIME,Dragonstone.JAIME approaches the depiction of Dragonstone in the mural and stands over it.
JAIME,They have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied
CERSEI,Enemies to the east.CERSEI walks towards Dorne on the mural.
CERSEI,Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.CERSEI walks towards Highgarden on the mural.
CERSEI,Enemies to the west--Olenna
CERSEI,Enemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?
JAIME,Winter is here. We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain
CERSEI,Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?
JAIME,If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now
CERSEI,I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
JAIME,Three kingdoms
CERSEI,I understand we're in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.
JAIME,A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We're the last of us.
CERSEI,A dynasty for us
JAIME,We never talked about Tommen.CERSEi turns and walks to a nearby table and pours herself a glass of wine.
CERSEI,There's nothing to say.
JAIME,Our baby boy killed himself.
CERSEI,He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother
JAIME,Cersei--CERSEI: I loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters
JAIME,Even Lannisters can't survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.
CERSEI,I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?
JAIME,We couldn't. He was a useless
CERSEI,You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?CUT TO: KING'S LANDING - BLACKWATER BAYShips bearing the kraken sigil of House Greyjoy are sailing into port. CERSEI and JAIME watch the boats from the shore
JAIME,The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?
CERSEI,Not all of them.
JAIME,Well
CERSEI,I invited Euron Greyjoy
JAIME,How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.
CERSEI,So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys
JAIME,They're not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They're bitter
CERSEI,Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.
JAIME,Oh
CERSEI,A queen.CERSEI exits
EURON,The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands
EURON,It's nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members
JAIME,You're not a rightful monarch
JAIME,The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs
EURON,I remember very well. I saw you. I heard so much talk. The best in the world. No one can stop him. I didn't believe it
JAIME,The people I was cutting down were your own kin.
EURON,The place was getting crowded. I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.
JAIME,And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.
EURON,A good thing for me. If you hadn't crushed us
CERSEI,If not the most humble.
EURON,You're not humble. You're the queen of a great nation. You don't care about the Iron Islands. They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--and a lot of very unattractive people. The Iron Fleet
CERSEI,What do you want in return?
EURON,Ever since I was a little boy
CERSEI,I decline your proposal.
EURON,Why?
CERSEI,You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.
EURON,You should try it. Feels wonderful.EURON chuckles. JAIME looks at CERSEI.
EURON,I don't expect you to trust me outright. You need proof of my honest intentions. In my experience

MARWYN,What's the weight?
SAM,Um
SAM,I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.
MARWYN,I don't remember your proposition.
SAM,I asked you if
MARWYN,That area is reserved for maesters. Are you a maester?
SAM,No.
MARWYN,Not a very strong proposition
SAM,Archmaester
MARWYN,Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything. It's their job. But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication. Too many similarities from unconnected sources.
SAM,Sources in the restricted area?
MARWYN,The very same. And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.
SAM,So
MARWYN,I do. You'll finish weighing that heart?
SAM,That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.
MARWYN,We're not lie the people south of the Twins. And we're not like the people north of the Twins. In the Citadel

BRIENNE,Nope.They reset. POD advances and they exchange several sword blows but POD missteps again and BRIENNE tags him on the behind. POD grunts.
BRIENNE,Nope.TORMUND approaches and stares at BRIENNE. BRIENNE looks at him. POD catches her off guard and tags her shoulder with his blade. She punches him in his gut and tosses him in the snow. TORMUND looks at POD.
TORMUND,You're a lucky man.PETYR BAELISH and SANSA stand on a walkway above the courtyard
PETYR,I've heard she beat the Hound in single combat. She's a very impressive woman.
SANSA,What do you want
PETYR,I want you to be happy. I want you to be safe.
SANSA,I am safe. I'm at home
PETYR,What about happy? Why aren't you happy? What do you want that you do not have?
SANSA,At the moment
SANSA,No need to seize the last word
PETYR,My lady.PETYR looks at SANSA.
PETYR,My lady.PETYR walks down the steps and into the courtyard.
BRIENNE,Why is he still here?SANSA sighs.
SANSA,We need his men. Without the Vale
BRIENNE,He wants something.
SANSA,I know exactly what he wants.
EXT. RIVERLANDS - FORESTARYA is riding a horse through the forest. She happens upon a group of Lannister soldiers sitting by a fire.MAN,He rode through the streets of the city / Down from his hill on high / O'er the winds and the steps and the cobble / He rode to a woman's sigh / For she was his secret treasure / She was his shame and his bliss / And a chain and a keep are nothing / Compared to a woman's kiss / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are warm / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are--ARYA's horse neighs. The men turn to look at her. One stands.
ARYA,That's a pretty song. I've never heard it before.

THOROS,Bad night to be outdoors.
SANDOR,"You've got real powerful magic to figure that out. Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear? ""It's snowing"
THOROS,You're a grouchy old bear
SANDOR,Don't like that shit. It's too sweet.
THOROS,Why are you always in such a foul mood?
SANDOR,Experience.The horses all stop.
BERIC,This seems like a good place to spend the night.They all stare at a nearby farmhouse.
SANDOR,These people don't want us here.
BERIC,Seems deserted to me. No livestock. No smoke coming from the chimney.BERIC urges his horse onward. The others follow.
SANDOR,I don't like the look of it.THOROS dismounts his horse.
THOROS,For a big
SANDOR,I'll tell you what doesn't scare me--bald cocksuckers like you. You think you're fooling anyone with that top knot? Bald cunt.THOROS smiles.
THOROS,Come on. Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.
SANDOR,They don't.CUT TO: RIVERLANDS - FARMHOUSE Some of the Brothers enter the farmhouse
THOROS,See if there's a larder. They always leave something behind.The Brothers rummage around the farmhouse. SANDOR enters.
BERIC,How do you think it ended for them?
SANDOR,With death.
BERIC,Girl died in her father's arms. Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet. I'd say they were starving. And rather than letting his little girl suffer
SANDOR,Doesn't matter now.
BERIC,No
SANDOR,I've known you a long time
BERIC,Aye. I think the first time we met was at that tournament--
SANDOR,And I always thought you were dull as dirt.BERIC chuckles.
SANDOR,You're not bad. I don't hate you. Don't like
BERIC,Thank you
SANDOR,But there's nothing special about you.
BERIC,You're right about that.
SANDOR,So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back? I've met better men than you
BERIC,You think I don't ask myself that? Every hour of every day? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? What does the Lord see in me?
SANDOR,And?
BERIC,I don't know. I don't understand our Lord.
SANDOR,Your Lord.
BERIC,I don't know what He wants from me. I only know that He wants me alive.
SANDOR,If he's so all-powerful
THOROS,Clegane.SANDOR looks at THOROS
THOROS,Come over here. Don't worry. The fire won't bite. I want to show you something.
SANDOR,It's my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers.
BERIC,Aye. Almost seems like divine justice.
SANDOR,There's no divine justice
SANDOR,What do you want?
THOROS,Look into the flames.
SANDOR,I don't want to look in the damn flames.
THOROS,You saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down. Don't you want to know what gave me the power?
SANDOR,I keep asking and no one wants to tell me.
THOROS,We can't tell you. Only the fire can tell you.SANDOR approaches the fire and looks into it.
THOROS,What do you see?
SANDOR,Logs burning.
THOROS,Keep looking. What do you see?SANDOR's face twists.
SANDOR,Ice. A wall of ice. The Wall.
THOROS,What else?
SANDOR,It's where the Wall meets the sea. There's a castle there.The fire crackles.
SANDOR,There's a mountain. Looks like an arrowhead. The dead are marching past.BERIC stands and approaches the fire.
SANDOR,Thousands of them.
BERIC,Do you believe me now
THOROS,What the hell are you doing
SANDOR,Burying the dead.SANDOR walks over to the body of the child
THOROS,You knew these people.
SANDOR,Not really.SANDOR stands
SANDOR,We ask the Father to judge us with mercy. We ask the Mother to... Fuck it
LITTLE SAM,Mom.GILLY turns to SAM.
GILLY,You should really sleep
SAM,The dead don't.GILLY stands
GILLY,"""Legends of the Long Night.""GILLY opens the book."
SAM,The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for.SAM sighs and turns the page. There is a diagram of a knife on the page. He turns the page again. There is a map on the page. SAM looks more closely at the map.
GILLY,What is it?
SAM,It's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.SAM points to a section of the map depicting a cave surrounded by a black mass.
GILLY,That's dragonglass?
SAM,A mountain of it. Beneath the ground. Stannis told me
JORAH,Has she come yet?
SAM,Who?
JORAH,The Dragon Queen. Daenerys Stormborn.
SAM,Haven't heard anything.JORAH pulls his hand back inside the cell. SAM approaches and folds up the plank.
DAENERYS,Shall we begin?
TYRION,On a night like this you came into the world.
VARYS,I remember that storm. All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.
DAENERYS,I wish I could remember it.DAENERYS turns away from the window and walks over to the table.
DAENERYS,I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.
TYRION,We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.
DAENERYS,Good.DAENERYS looks at the figurines placed on the table
DAENERYS,Not so many lions.
VARYS,Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival they plotted against her. Now...
DAENERYS,They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?DAENERYS walks closer to VARYS.
DAENERYS,People used to tell my brother that sort of thing and he was stupid enough to believe them.DAENERYS picks up a dragon figurine from the table.
DAENERYS,If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back he'd have invaded King's Landing already.
TYRION,Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.
DAENERYS,No.DAENERYS puts down the dragon figurine.
TYRION,We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side we have powerful allies in the south.DAENERYS looks at VARYS.
DAENERYS,I never properly thanked you for that.
VARYS,They joined our side my queen because they believe in you.
DAENERYS,You served my father didn't you Lord Varys?
VARYS,I did.
DAENERYS,And then you served the man who overthrew him?
VARYS,I had a choice Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe.
DAENERYS,But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.
VARYS,Robert was an improvement on your father to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king.
DAENERYS,So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.
TYRION,Your Grace when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--
DAENERYS,Before I came to power you favored my brother. All your spies your little birds did they tell you Viserys was cruel stupid and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?
VARYS,Until your marriage to Khal Drogo Your Grace I knew nothing about you save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful.
DAENERYS,So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.
VARYS,Which you turned to your advantage.
DAENERYS,Who gave the order to kill me?
VARYS,King Robert.
DAENERYS,Who hired the assassins?DAENERYS walks closer to VARYS.
DAENERYS,Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?
VARYS,Your Grace I did what had to be done to--
DAENERYS,To keep yourself alive.
TYRION,Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.
DAENERYS,Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?
VARYS,The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child I lived in alleys gutters abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you.
DAENERYS,Swear this to me Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.
VARYS,I swear it my queen.
DAENERYS,And I swear this--if you ever betray me I'll burn you alive.VARYS smiles.
VARYS,I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.
GREY WORM,Forgive me my queen. A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you.CUT TO: DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOMMELISANDRE is standing alone in the throne room. DAENERYS enters accompanied by TYRION VARYS MISSANDEI and GREY WORM. They approach MELISANDRE.
MELISANDRE,Queen Daeneys I was a slave once bought and sold scourged and branded.  It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains.
DAENERYS,The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen.  You are very welcome here.  What is your name?
MELISANDRE,I am called Melisandre.VARYS begins speaking English.
VARYS,She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne.  It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon did it?
MELISANDRE,No it didn't.
DAENERYS,You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.DAENERYS turns to look at Varys.
DAENERYS,We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.VARYS bows his head to DAENERYS.  DAENERYS turns back to MELISANDRE.
DAENERYS,The Lord of Light doesn't have  many followers in Westeros does he?
MELISDANDRE,Not yet.   But even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.
DAENERYS,What does your Lord expect from me?MELISANDRE begins speaking Valyrian again.
MELISANDRE,The Long Night is coming.  Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn.DAENERYS speaking in English.
DAENERYS,The prince who was promised will bring the dawn.  I'm afraid I'm not a prince.
MISSANDEI,Your Grace forgive me but your translation is not quite accurate.  That noun has no gender in High Valyrian so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn.
TYRION,Doesn't really roll off the tongue does it?
DAENERYS,No but I like it better.DAENERYS turns back to MELISANDRE.
DAENERYS,And you believe this prophecy refers to me?
MELISANDRE,Prophecies are dangerous things.  I believe you have a roll to play as does another.  The King in the North Jon Snow.
TYRION,Jon Snow?  Ned Stark's bastard?
DAENERYS,You know him?
TYRION,I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.
VARYS,And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames that is?
MELISANDRE,As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger.  As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy.
DAENERYS,He sounds like quite a man.
MELISANDRE,Summon Jon Snow.  Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him the things that he has seen with his own eyes.
TYRION,I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him and I am an excellent judge of character.DARNERYS smiles at Tyrion.
TYRION,If he does rule the north he would make a valuable ally.  The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother.  Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.DAENERYS pauses for a moment.
DAENERYS,Very well.  Send a raven north.  Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARDYoung boys and girls are practicing archery.  JON SANSA and DAVOS stand on the upper level watching the training.
SANSA,Do you think it's really Tyrion?  It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.
JON,Read the last bit.
SANSA,"""All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes.""  What does that mean?"
JON,It's something he said to me the first night we met.  You know him better than any of us.  What do you think?
SANSA,"Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters.  He was always kind to me but it's too great a risk.  ""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne.  Join us.  Together we can end her tyranny."""
DAVOS,Sounds like a charmer.  Of course the casual mention of a Dothraki horde a legion of Unsullied and three dragons a bit less charming.DAVOS pauses to ponder something.
JON,What?
DAVOS,Fire kills Whites you told me.  What breathes fire?
SANSA,You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?
DAVOS,No too dangerous.
JON,But?
DAVOS,But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall do we have enough men to fight them?JON gazes back to the courtyard looking concerned.CUT TO: RED KEEP - THRONEROOMCERSEI sits on the Iron Throne.  She is surrounded by JAIME QYBURN THE MOUNTAIN and members of her Queensguard.  Many lords are in attendance including RANDYLL TARLEY.CERSEI:  If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne she will destroy the Realm as we know it.  Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell.  But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown.  With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores.  Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts.  Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground rape and enslave your women and butcher your children without a second thought.  This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty.The lords begin murmuring amongst themselves.
CERSEI,You all remember the Mad King.  You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people.  His daughter is no different.  In Essos her brutality is already legendary.  She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay.  And when she grew bored of that she fed them to her dragons.The lords murmur louder
CERSEI,It is my solemn duty to protect the people and I will but I need your help My Lords.  We must stand together all of us if we hope to stop her.RANDYLL TARLEY slowly approaches the throne.
RANDYLL,She has three full-grown dragons Your Grace.  The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms.  How do you propose to stop them?CERSEI glances over to QYBURN.
QYBURN,We are currently at work on a solution My Lord.The meeting disbands.  All the lords walk out into the hall outside of the throne room.  JAIME approaches RANDYLL TARLEY and begins to walk with him.
JAIME,Lord Tarley.
RANDYLL,Ser Jaime.  I believe you know my son.
DICKON,Ser Jaime.
JAIME,Rickon isn't it?
DICKON,Dickon.
JAIME,That's it.JAIME walks past Dickon and begins a discussion with Randyll
JAIME,Thank you for coming.  The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever.  They might not have come if you hadn't.
RANDYLL,If my queen summons me I answer the call.  And I've heard what she does to those that defy her.JAIME and RANDYLL walk to an unoccupied hallway and continue their conversation.
JAIME,Do you ride for Hornhill today?
RANDYLL,I have an army to mobilize.  It won't be long until the fighting starts.
JAIME,And what side will you be fighting for?  You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle.  Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --
RANDYLL,It's a long ride back to the reach Ser Jaime.  How may I serve?
JAIME,I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come.  I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies.  All of her enemies.
RANDYLL,Including Olenna Tyrell?  I'm a Tarley.  That name means something.  We're not oath breakers.  We're not schemers.  We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings.   I swore an oath to House Tyrell.
JAIME,You swore an oath to the Crown as well Lord Tarley.
RANDYLL,I've known Olenna since I was a child.
JAIME,She was a great woman once.  Now she's broken.  She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores.  The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history.  I know you don't like my sister but you have to make a choice.  Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?RANDYLL nods his head in agreement
JAIME,When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south.  I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.CUT TO:  CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMSARCHMAESTER MARWYN SAMWELL and JORAH are standing together in the quarantine room.  JORAH's upper body is covered in Greyscale except his face.
MARWYN,The infection has spread too far.  You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.
JORAH,How long?
MARWYN,It will be years before it kills you.  It could be 10 could be 20.
JORAH,But how long 'till...
MARWYN,Your mind?  Six months maybe fewer.JORAH sighs and sits down on his bed.  SAMWELL approaches MARWYN.
SAMWELL,Pardon Archmaester.  I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black.  She had Greyscale as a baby and was cured.  Isn't there some way --
MARWYN,Does this look like a baby to you?
SAMWELL,No.
MARWYN,Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?
SAMWELL,No.
MARWYN,Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.MARWYN turns to face JORAH.
MARWYN,This is quite advanced and beyond our skills Ser.  Were you a commoner I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the Stone Men.  As an anointed Knight I'll allow you one more day.  How you choose to spend that time is up to you.JORAH nods his head.  MARWYN turns to leave the room and begins walking to the door.
MARWYN,Come Samwell.
SAMWELL,Should we send word to your family Ser...
JORAH,Jorah.  Jorah Mormont.
SAMWELL,Mormont?
JORAH,There's no need.  I've been dead to them for years.MARWYN is waiting for SAMWELL in the hallway
MARWYN,Come Samwell.SAMWELL turns and walks out of the room.  He closes the door to the quarantine room.CUT TO:  UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONSQYBURN and CERSEI are walking along the torch lit dungeon passing the dragon skulls.
QYBURN,Have you ever been down here Your Grace?
CERSEI,No I can't say I have.  I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room.
QYBURN,Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.
CERSEI,They were his trophies.  He couldn't keep them around.  They would have made him look small.  Sometimes he would come down here and look at them.  I believe he brought his whores on occasion.QYBURN and CERSEI arrive at the end of the dungeon.  They are looking at the largest dragon skull in the room.
QYBURN,Balerion the Dread.  The beast that Aegon rode across the sea.  Its flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.  Powerful but not invincible.QYBURN turns and starts walking away from the dragon skull.
QYBURN,Apparently one of Daenarys' dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen.  If they can be wounded they can be killed.QYBURN walks up to a machine covered by a cloth.  He reaches up and removes the cloth revealing an artillery-sized crossbow aimed at Balerion's skull.
QYBURN,The finest artilleters and blacksmiths in King's Landing have been laboring day and night Your Grace.  If you'd kindly pull that lever.CERSEI releases a lever on the machine and launches a giant bolt directly into Balerion's eye socket.  The bolt buries deep into the skull and gets stuck.  CERSEI stands behind the machine smirking.CUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLEDAENERYS YARA GREYJOY THEON GREYJOY ELLARIA SAND OLEN TYRELL VARYS GREY WORM
YARA,If you want the Iron Throne take it.  We have an army a fleet and three dragons.  We should hit King's Landing now.  Hard.  With everything we have.  The city will fall within a day.
TYRION,If we turn the dragons loose tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.ELLARIA looks at TYRION with disgust.
ELLARIA,It's called war.  You don't have the stomach for it scurry back into hiding.
TYRION,I know how you wage war.  We don't poison little girls here.  Myrcella was innocent.
ELLARIA,She was a Lannister.  There are no innocent Lannisters.  My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.
DAENERYS,That's enough.  Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen.  You will treat him with respect.DAENERYS pauses for a moment.
DAENERYS,I am not here to be queen of the ashes.OLEN addresses DAENERYS from across the table.
OLENNA,That's very nice to hear.  Of course I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter.  The common people loved her the nobles loved her.  And what is left of her now?  Ashes.  Commoners nobles they're all just children really.  They won't obey you unless they fear you.
DAENERYS,I'm grateful to you Lady Olenna for your council.  I'm grateful to all of you.  But you have chosen to follow me.  I will not attack King's Landing.  We will not attack King's Landing.
OLEANNA,Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne?  By asking nicely?
DAENERYS,We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides.  Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.
TYRION,But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.TYRION begins walking around the carved table of Westeros.
TYRION,Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty their love for their country.  If we besiege the city with foreigners we prove her point.  Our army should be Westerosi.
ELLIA,And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?
TYRION,You are.TYRION reaches down and picks up a figurine that resembles a Kraken in a longship.
TYRION,Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.TYRION walks to the south of the map and picks up a figurine that resembles a sun.  He takes both figurines and places them at King's Landing.
TYRION,The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army.  Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.
OLENNA,So your master plan is to use our armies?  Forgive me for asking but why did you bother to bring your own?TYRION reaches down and picks up the figurine resembling an Unsullied helmet.  He begins walking back around the map of Westeros.
TYRION,The unsullied will have another objective.  For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros.  And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock.  Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.TYRION stops in front of Casterly Rock.  There is a figurine that resembles a lion.  He knocks the lion over with the Unsullied figurine.  Everyone in the room nods in agreement.
DAENERYS,Do I have your support?
YARA,You have mine.
ELLIA,Dorne is with you Your Grace.Lady Olenna nods her head in agreement.
DAENERYS,Thank you all.  Lady Olenna may I speak with you alone?Everyone except DAENERYS and OLEN leave the Chamber of the Painted Table.  DAENERYS walks to the end and sits next to OLEN.
DAENERYS,I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me.  But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.
OLENNA,Peace.  Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his?  Peace never lasts my dear.  Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?DAENERYS nods her hod in agreement
OLENNA,He's a clever man your Hand.  I've known a great many clever men.  I've outlived them all.  Do you know why?  I ignored them.  The lords of Westeros are sheep.  Are you a sheep?  No.  You're a dragon.  Be a dragon.CUT TO - DRAGONSTONE - GREY WORM'S QUARTERSGREY WORM is sitting sharpening his sword.  Someone knocks on his door.  He begins speaking Valyrian.
GREY WORM,Enter.MISSANDEI walks in.  She speaks in English.
MISSANDEI,You leave tomorrow.  Were you going to say goodbye?
GREY WORM,I will see you when I return.
MISSANDEI,But you don't know when that will be.
GREYWORM,No one knows.
MISSANDEI,I wish you good fortune.MISSANDEI turns and starts to walk out of the room.
GREY WORM,Missandei --MISSANDEI stops and turns back towards GREY WORM.
GREY WORM,It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.
MISSANDEI,Why?
GREY WORM,You know why.
MISSANDEI,I don't.
GREY WORM,You are my weakness.MISSANDEI appears offended.
MISSANDEI,That's what I am?  Your weakness?
GREY WORM,When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears.  One boy is scared of dogs.  One boy hates high places.  One is frightened of the ocean.  They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff.  They throw him in the water.  If he learns to swim good.  If he drowns good.  Either way strong Unsullied.  But I had no fears.  I was never the biggest never the strongest but I was bravest always.
MISSANDEI,I believe it.
GREY WORM,Until I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth.  Now I have fear.
MISSANDEI,I do too.GREY WORM steps forward and kisses MISSANDEI.  MISSANDEI grabs his hands and stops him.  She begins to undress herself.  MISSANDEI steps forward and begins to undress GREY WORM.
GREY WORM,No.
MISSANDEI,I want to see you.  Please.GREY WORM hesitates for a moment then nods his head in agreement.  MISSANDEI finishes undressing GREY WORM.  Sex scene ensues.CUT TO - CITADEL LIBRARYMARWYN and SAMWELL are walking by various shelves in the library.  SAMWELL is carrying a stack of books for MARWYN.
MARWYN,It might be useful.  Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher.
SAMWELL,Archmaester I wanted to --
MARWYN,And this one.MARWYN places another book on the stack SAMWELL is carrying.
MARWYN,Maester Faol was quite the opposite.  A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.MARWYN continues walking
SAMWELL,I wanted to ask you --
MARWYN,If you need to write histories Tarley you have to do the research.  If you want people to read your histories you need a bit of style.  I'm not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread.SAMWELL says nothing.
MARWYN,What?  You don't like the title?  What would you call it then?
SAMWELL,Possibly something a bit more poetic?
MARWYN,We're not poets Tarley.
SAMWELL,Archmaester if I could just have a moment.
MARWYN,This is your moment.  Use it wisely.MARWYN begins looking through books on the shelf.
SAMWELL,I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah.  There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured.  I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos.MARWYN places a book on SAMWELL's stack.  He continues looking at more books.
MARWYN,I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases.
SAMWELL,Oh you are?
MARWYN,Yes.  Should I tell you how he died?  From Greyscale.MARWYN places another book on SAMWELL's stack.
SAMWELL,Oh.
MARWYN,The procedure is far too dangerous which is why it's now forbidden.MARWYN turns and walks out of the library.CUT TO: QUARANTINE ROOMSA few hours have passed.  JORAH is writing a letter to DAENERYS by candlelight in his quarantine room.  He hears a noise in the hallway and stands to face the door.  SAMWELL opens the door and rolls in a cart filled with medical tools and containers.
SAMWELL,Hello.
JORAH,What are you doing?
SAMWELL,You're Jorah Mormont.  You're the only son of Jeor Mormont.SAMWELL picks up a roll of leather and sets it on the table.  He unrolls it revealing an assortment of scalpels and knives.
SAMWELL,My name is Samwell Tarley.  I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch training to serve as maester of Castle Black.  I knew your father.  I was with him when he died.  You're not dying today Ser Jorah.SAMWELL picks up a large flask and hands it to JORAH.
SAMWELL,Drink this.
JORAH,What is it?
SAMWELL,Rum.  Drink it all please.  I'm afraid this is going to hurt.JORAH reaches for the bottle.  SAMWELL grabs it back and drinks some himself before handing it back to JORAH.  JORAH drains the flask.  SAMWELL picks up a thick book from the medical cart and sets it on the table.
SAMWELL,If you could take off your shirt.SAMWELL gives JORAH a strap made of leather.
SAMWELL,If you wouldn't mind bite down hard.  I'm sorry but no one knows I'm here.  If they hear you screaming then we're both finished.
JORAH,Have you ever done this before?
SAMWELL,No.  No one else will try so I'm the best you've got.  Have a seat.  I'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue then apply a medicinal ointment to the --JORAH looks at SAMWELL to stop him from explaining.  SAMWELL picks up a pair of tweezers and a scalpel.  He grabs a section of Greyscale to cut it off.  JORAH recoils in pain.
SAMWELL,Shh shhh.  Again I'm sorry.  Please try not to scream.SAMWELL cuts into the Greyscale.  JORAH begins to writhe in agony and whimper.  Pus is dripping from the wound.  SAMWELL continues cutting and slices a layer of Greyscale off JORAH's skin.CUT TO:  INN AT THE CROSSROADSTwo men are at a table having a conversation.
MAN #1,They say her dragons are bigger than Aegons.
MAN #2,Horse shit.  Cersei is just trying to frighten us.
MAN #1,If it's true if she lays siege to King's Landing prices will triple.The camera zooms out showing Arya eavesdropping on the men.
MAN #2,As long as we get back there before they start.
MAN #1,One more round.  It's a long ride.A waiter approaches Arya's table.
HOT PIE,Ary!
ARYA,Hello Hot Pie.  Sit down.  Who's that for?Arya reaches over and grabs a potpie from the tray and starts eating it.
ARYA,Mmm.  This is good.
HOT PIE,You think so?  The secret is browning the butter before making the dough.  Most people don't don't do that because it takes up too much time.
ARYA,I didn't do that.HOT PIE:  You've been making pies?
ARYA,One or two.
HOT PIE,I can't believe you're here.  Did you meet the big lady?
ARYA,Big lady?
HOT PIE,The lady knight.  I figured she was a knight because she had armor on.  She was looking for your sister but I told her about you.  Did she ever find you?
ARYA,She found me.
HOT PIE,What happened to you Ary?ARYA pauses and doesn't answer HOT PIE.
ARYA,You got any ale?Hot Pie starts to reach for a pitcher on the tray.  Arya reaches over and grabs it before him pouring herself a cup.
HOT PIE,Where are you heading?
ARYA,King's Landing.
HOT PIE,Why?
ARYA,I heard Cersei's queen now.
HOT PIE,I heard she blew up the Great Sept.  That must have been something to see.  Boom.
ARYA,Hmm.Arya nods in agreement.
HOT PIE,I can't believe someone could do that.
ARYA,Cersei would do that.
HOT PIE,I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.
ARYA,Why would I go there?  The Boltons have it.
HOT PIE,No.  The Boltons are dead.Arya stops eating and drops her food.
ARYA,What?
HOT PIE,Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a Wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards.  He's King in the North now.
ARYA,You're lying.
HOT PIE,Why would I lie about that?  He's your brother right?ARYA starts picking up her things to leave.
ARYA,Thanks for the pie.Arya reaches to her side and produces a bag of gold.  She starts to open the pouch.
HOT PIE,Friends don't pay.  I can't believe I thought you were a boy.  You're pretty.
ARYA,Thanks.Arya stands and walks past Hot Pie.  She turns and puts her hand on his shoulder.
ARYA,Take care of yourself Hot Pie.  Try not to get killed.
HOT PIE,No I won't.  I'm like you Ary.  I'm a survivor.ARYA turns and exits the InnCUT TO:  EXT. INN AT THE CROSSROADSARYA climbs on her horse.  She looks towards the south then the north.

There's a knock at the door.
JON,Come in.
WOLKAN,A raven My King from the Citadel.JON begins reading the scroll.CUT TO:  WINTERFELL - GREAT HALLThe room is filled with northern lords and ladies including SANSA JON BRIENNE LYAN MORMONT ROBETT GLOVER YOHN ROYCE
JON,This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley.  He was my brother at the Night's Watch.  A man I trust as much as anyone in this world.  He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.The lords murmur amongst themselves.  JON hands the first note to ROBETT GLOVER.  JON holds up a different note for the lords to see.
JON,I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone.  It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.The lords murmur louder.
JON,He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen.  She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister.  She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed three dragons.The lords speak among themselves and look concerned.
JON,Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.There is a negative outcry from the lords gathered in the hall
JON,We need this Dragonglass My Lords.  We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army.  We need to mine it and turn it into weapons.The lords nod in agreement
JON,But more importantly we need allies.  The Night King's army grows larger by the day.  We can't defeat them on our own.  We don't have the numbers.  Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire.  I need to try and persuade her to fight with us.  Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow then sail for Dragonstone.
SANSA,Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather?  The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.
JON,I know that.
SANSA,She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.  The north is one of those seven kingdoms.  This isn't an invitation it's a trap.
JON,It could be but I don't believe Tyrion would do that.  You know him.  He's a good man.YOHN ROYCE stands up and turns to face JON.
YOHN ROYCE,Your Grace with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa.  I remember the Mad King all too well.  A Targaryen cannot be trusted nor can a Lannister.The lords shout in agreement.
ROBETT GLOVER,We called your brother king and then he rode south and lost his kingdom.
LYANNA MORMONT,Winter is here Your Grace.  We need the King in the North in the north.The lords pound the tables in agreement.
JON,You all crowned me your king.  I never wanted it I never asked for it but I accepted it because the north is my home.  It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it no matter the odds.  But the odds are against us.  None of you have seen the Army of the Dead.  None of you.  We can never hope to defeat them alone.  We need allies powerful allies.  I know it's a risk.  But I have to take it.
SANSA,Then send an emissary.  Don't go yourself.
JON,Daenerys is a queen.  Only a king can convince her to help us.  It has to be me.
SANSA,You're abandoning your people.  Your abandoning your home.
JON,I'm leaving both in good hands.
SANSA,Whose?
JON,Yours.  You are my sister.  You are the only Stark in Winterfell.  Until I return the north is yours.CUT TO: WINTERFELL - THE CRYPTJON stands in the torchlit crypt looking at a statue of Ned Stark.  LORD BAELISH approaches him.
BAELISH,I delivered his bones myself.  I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister.  It seems like a lifetime ago.  Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.Baelish looks up at the statue of Ned Stark.
BAELISH,I was sorry when he died.  Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much.  So did I.  She wasn't fond of you was she?  Well it appears she vastly underestimated you.  Your father and brothers are gone yet here you stand King in the North.  Last best hope against the coming storm.JON turns to face BAELISH.
JON,You don't belong down here.
BAELISH,Forgive me.  We have never talked properly.  I wanted to remedy that.
JON,I have nothing to say to you.
BAELISH,Not even thank you?  If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield.  You have many enemies My King but I swear to you I'm not one of them.  I love Sansa as I loved her mother.JON grabs BAELISH by the throat and pushes him against the wall.  BAELISH begins choking.
JON,Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.JON releases BAELISH.  JON turns and walks to exit the crypt.CUT TO:  WINTERFELL - COURTYARDJON walks into the courtyard towards his horse.  SER DAVOS is seated on his own horse awaiting him.  JON climbs onto his horse and looks back.  He sees SANSA on the upper level of the courtyard.  JON waves goodbye and SANSA waves back.  JON DAVOS and Winterfell guards ride out of the gate and exit the courtyard.  BAELISH exits from the crypt looking shaken.CUT TO:  RIVERLANDSARYA is building a fire.  Her horse is tied to a tree.  The horse begins to whinny.  ARYA stands and grabs her sword from beside the fire.  Multiple wolves come from the woods and begin to circle her.  A large grey and white dire wolf approaches her barring teeth.
ARYA,Nymeria?ARYA sets her sword down and begins to approach the dire wolf.
ARYA,Nymeria it's me Arya.  I'm heading north girl back to Winterfell.  I'm finally going home.  Come with me.ARYA stretches her hand out towards the dire wolf.
ARYA,Come with me.The dire wolf turns and begins to leave.  All the other wolves walk away with it.  ARYA whispers to herself.

TYENE,Momma will want Cersei for herself.
OBARA,She's not my momma.  You can have Cersei.  I want The Mountain.
NYMERIA,The Mountain killed father.  He'll crush you with one hand.
TYENE,Father got careless.  That's what Momma says.
OBARA,Will you shut up about Momma?  Momma momma.OBARA begins mocking TYENE.
TYENE,Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing and then I won't have to share.OBARA and NYMERIA mock TYENE in unison.CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE - INT.

YARA,A few times.  Never stayed long.
ELLARIA,A boy in every port?
YARA,A boy a girl.  Depends on the port.
ELLARIA,Could we get some more?ELLARIA hands her empty cup back to THEON.
YARA,I thought it wasn't for you.
ELLARIA,I'm developing a taste for it.YARA looks at THEON
YARA,He's not your servant.
THEON,It's fine.THEON begins filling the cup from a barrel of wine.
ELLARIA,So you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands.
YARA,Once I kill my uncle.
ELLARIA,And what will you be handsome?ELLARIA stands and gropes THEON.
THEON,Whatever my queen demands.YARA:  He'll be my advisor my protector.
ELLARIA,Oh I see.  Your protector.ELLARIA slowly walks towards YARA.
ELLARIA,So if someone gets too close to you --
YARA,He might have to intervene.
ELLARIA,-- hold that person back.
YARA,Until they've made their intentions known.ELLARIA sits next to YARA and spreads her legs apart then looks at THEON.
ELLARIA,Why are you standing all the way over there then?  A foreign invasion is under way.  It seems like you don't need a protector.A large crash is heard and the ship rocks back and forth.  YARA turns to ELLARIA.
YARA,Stay here.YARA stands picks up her sword and rushes for the stairs to the upper deck.  THEON follows her.CUT TO: SEA OF DORNE - EXT. YARA'S SHIPYARA climbs onto the deck and sees mayhem.  There are flaming arrows and flares in the sky.  YARA turns to survey the madness.  A ship bearing the Greyjoy sigil comes sailing out of the smoke and fog directly at YARA's ship.
YARA,Euron.EURON'S ship crashes into YARA's.  An armored gang plank is dropped onto YARA's ship.  Euron Greyjoy is riding on top of the plank as it crashes onto YARA's ship.  A sailor is crushed in the process.  Euron boards YARA's boat and begins cutting men down with an ax and laughing maniacally.  Dozens of men are rushing behind him to board YARA'S ship.  YARA and THEON both yell and leap into battle.  Many people are killed instantly.  More men are running over the gang plank.  TYENE SAND comes from below deck.  She throws a dagger and lodges it in an invader's eye.  She moves to the body to retrieve her knife.  YARA approaches her and kneels beside her.

She stands up and heads down into the captain's quarters.CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERSTYENE walks down the stairs and sees her mother ELLARIA SAND.

Flaming arrows are streaking in and men are shouting.  A flaming bolt flies through the air and hits YARA's mast causing it to burst into flames.  More men are rushing from EURON'S boat onto the deck.  YARA is slowly walking and watching the scene unfold.  She then turns and continues fighting.  EURON is cutting through men with ease.  He has just killed another when a whip lashes around his throat.  NYMERIA pulls on the whip and brings EURON towards her.  Euron turns and punches her in the face.

JON,Of course.The Dothraki guard move to take the weapons.  JON unties his sword and hands it over.  The Dothraki pick up JON's boat and begin to carry it away.
MISSANDEI,Please

TYRION,Good.  At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.
JON,As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.
TYRION,A long and bloody tale.  To be honest
JON,My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.
TYRION,Of course they do.  If I was your hand I would have advised against it.  General rule of thumb
TYRION,I'd say you get used to them
TYRION,Come.  Their mother is waiting for you.JON and DAVOS exchange glances.  They continue walking up the path.  The camera shifts focus to MELISANDRE who is far above the group watching them from a cliff.  VARYS approaches MELISANDRE from behind and stands next to her.
VARYS,I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests.  You begged us to summon the King in the North.  Don't you want to see him again?
MELISANDRE,I've done my part.  I've brought ice and fire together.
VARYS,Strange.  You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff.  I didn't take you for a bashful girl.
MELISANDRE,My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.
VARYS,Oh
MELISANDRE,Neither of us is common folk anymore.  I did not part on good terms with the King in the North
VARYS,Why?
MELISANDRE,Because of mistakes I made.  Terrible mistakes.  I would only be a distraction if I stayed.
VARYS,So where will you go?
MELISANDRE,Volantis.
VARYS,Good.  If you don't mind my saying
MELISANDRE,I will return
VARYS,My Lady --
MELISANDRE,I have to die in this strange country
MISSANDEI,You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen
DAVOS,This is Jon Snow.DAVOS nods and pauses.
DAVOS,He's King in the North.TYRION smirks to himself.
DAENERYS,Thank you for traveling so far
JON,The winds were kind
DAVOS,Apologies.  I have a Flea Bottom accent
DAENERYS,Forgive me --
TYRION,Your Grace
DAERNEYS,Forgive me
DAVOS,I wasn't there
DAENERYS,No.  Of course not.  But still
TYRION,Forever.
DAENERYS,Forever.  So I assume
JON,I am not.
DAENERYS,Oh.  Well
JON,Break faith?  Your father burned my grandfather alive.  He burned my uncle alive.  He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.
DAENERYS,My father was an evil man.  On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family.  And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father.  Our two houses were allies for centuries.  Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known.  Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North.  I am the last Targaryen
JON,You're right.  You're not guilty of your father's crime.  And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.
DAENERYS,Then why are you here?
JON,Because I need your help and you need mine.DAENERYS smirks and looks over at TYRION.  She starts speaking to JON again.
DAENERYS,Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?
JON,I did.
DAENERYS,And did you see the Dothraki
JON,They're hard to miss.
DAENERYS,But still
DAVOS,Not to defeat Cersei.  You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall.  Hell
TYRION,Almost.
JON,But you haven't stormed King's Landing.  Why not?  The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people.  It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it.  Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.
DAENERYS,Still
JON,Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else
DAENERYS,You told me you liked this man.
TYRION,I do.
DAENERYS,In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen
TYRION,I believe he's calling all of us children.  Figure of speech.
JON,Your Grace
DAENERYS,As far as I can see
JON,I am not your enemy.  The dead are the enemy.DAENERYS pauses and is incredulous.
DAENERYS,The dead?DAENERYS addresses TYRION.
DAENERYS,Is that another figure of speech?JON answers her before Tyrion.
JON,The Army of the Dead is on the march.
TYRION,The Army of the Dead?
JON,You don't know me well
TYRION,No
JON,The Army of the Dead is real.  The White Walkers are real.  The Knight King is real.  I've seen them.  If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --JON begins walking closer to the throne.  The Dothraki guards step towards him to halt him.
JON,-- we're finished.DAENERYS pauses a moment.
DAENERYS,I was born at Dragonstone.  Not that I can remember it.DAENERYS stands from the throne and begins walking down the stairs towards JON.
DAENERYS,We fled before Robert's assassins could find us.  Robert was your father's best friend
DAENERYS,They did for me.  I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms.  And I will.
JON,You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.Tyrion steps up to stand next to DAENERYS and speaks to JON.
TYRION,The war against my sister has already begun.  You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --TYRION pauses a moment.
TYRION,-- whatever you saw beyond the wall.
DAVOS,You don't believe him.  I understand that.  It sounds like nonsense.JON nods in agreement.
DAVOS,But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores
DAVOS,All those things you don't believe in
DAVOS,If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die.  And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.
TYRION,If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.JON shakes his head and looks at the floor.
TYRION,Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys.  Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.
JON,There's no time for that.  There's no time for any of this.  While we stand here debating --
TYRION,It takes no time to bend the knee.  Pledge your sword to her cause.
JON,And why would I do that?JON turns to speak to DAENERYS.
JON,I mean no offense
DAENERYS,That's fair.  It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom
DAENERYS,You must forgive my manners.  You will both be tired after your long journey.  We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.DAENERYS begins speaking Valyrian to her Queensguard.  Her guard steps forward to escort JON and DAVOS.  JON speaks to DAENERYS.
JON,Am I your prisoner?
DAENERYS,Not yet.DAENERYS begins walking back to the throne.  JON and DAVOS exit the throne room with a member of the Queensguard.  The Dothraki close the door to the throne room after JON and DAVOS exit.  VARYS begins speaking to DAENERYS.
VARYS,Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.
DAENERYS,And?
VARYS,Two or three ships escaped.  The rest sunk our captured.  Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured.  The Greyjoys are dead or captured.
DAENERYS,All of them?CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNETheon is hanging on to flotsam on the ocean.  A friendly Greyjoy ship is pulling him out of the water with a rope.  They haul him onto the ship and drop him on deck.  He is shivering and dishelveled.  The captain of the boat approaches THEON and speaks to him while THEON is laying on the deck.
CAPTAIN,Your sister's dead?
THEON,Euron has her.
CAPTAIN,You saw him take her?  And you got away?
THEON,I couldn't save her.  I tried.
CAPTAIN,You wouldn't be here if you tried.THEON turns his eyes away from the captain.  The captain turns and walks away.  The men go back to their duties
CUT TO,KING'S LANDING - STREETSEURON is escorting prisoners YARA GREYJOY
EURON,This is the life.  Look at them.  Cheering for a Greyjoy.EURON pulls on the rope around YARA's neck forcing her to run forward to stand next to EURON's horse.
EURON,I have to be honest
EURON,Oh no!EURON laughs.
EURON,What a twat.CUT TO:  RED KEEP - THRONE ROOMCERSEI is sitting on the throne surrounded by QYBURN
EURON,My queen.  Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.EURON throws the chains at the feet of CERSEI.
EURON,I give you --EURON looks over to JAIME.
EURON,-- what no other man could give.  Justice.  Justice for your murdered daughter.ELLARIA spits onto the floor near the throne and CERSEI smiles.  CERSEI begins speaking to EURON.
CERSEI,You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.EURON leans in and speaks to CERSEI so the crowd can't hear.
EURON,A bit more than a true friend.
CERSEI,And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.
EURON,There's only one reward I want.
CERSEI,You shall have what your heart desires --JAIME looks over at CERSEI.
CERSEI,-- when the war is won.CERSEI stands and addresses the people gathered in the throne room.
CERSEI,With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies
EURON,There's nothing quite like it
JAIME,This same mob spat at my sister not long ago
EURON,Or yours.  They just like severed heads really.  Listen
JAIME,Advice?
EURON,Does she like it gentle or rough?  A finger in the bum?JAIME turns to EURON angrily.
EURON,Shhh
CERSEI,I want you to know I understand.  Even though we're enemies
CERSEI,The sound of your scream.  I never heard a sound like that.  I thought
CERSEI,It doesn't matter now.CERSEI walks across the room and stands next to TYENE looking at her but continues speaking to ELLARIA.
CERSEI,Your daughter is a beauty too.  Brown eyes
CERSEI,I imagine she is your favorite.ELLARIA pulls on her restraints.
CERSEI,I know
CERSEI,I'm sorry.  I can't understand you.  The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying.  It must be frustrating.ELLARIA whimpers.
CERSEI,We all make our choices.  You chose to murder my daughter.  You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.ELLARIA screams and pulls against her restraints.  She takes the slack out of the chain but is held in place inches from CERSEI.
CERSEI,Do you feel powerful now?  I don't sleep very well
CERSEI,I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.CERSEI removes the gag from TYENE's mouth.
CERSEI,She's so beautiful.  The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg
TYENE,Momma!ELLARIA screams and looks at CERSEI.  QYBURN steps to TYENE and puts the gag back on her mouth.  TYENE is crying.  QYBURN walks over to CERSEI and hands her a cloth.  ELLARIA falls down to her knees and is watching her daughter.  CERSEI starts wiping off the red lipstick she was wearing.  CERSEI speaks to ELLARIA.
CERSEI,Qyburn
QYBURN,The Long Farewell.QYBURN hands CERSEI a vile containing the posion antidote.
CERSEI,That's the one.CERSEI drinks the antidote.
CERSEI,How long does the poison take?
QYBURN,Difficult to say.  Hours
CERSEI,But death is certain?
QYBURN,Oh yes
CERSEI,Your daughter will die here in this cell.  You will be here watching when she does.  You will be here the rest of your days.  If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat.  You will live to watch your daughter rot
CERSEI,Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours.  I don't want her to miss a thing.CERSEI stands and walks out of the chamber with her entourage.  TYENE and ELLARIA both strain against their chains but can't reach each other.CUT TO:  RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERSJAIME sets his gold hand down on the table and pours himself a glass of wine.  CERSEI barges in and approaches him.  CERSEI starts kissing JAIME.
JAIME,No.CERSEI kisses JAIME.  JAIME stands.  CERSEI unties his pants and gets on her knees.  Sex scene ensues.  Some time has passed.  CERSEI is asleep and JAIME is watching her in bed.  There's a knock at the door.
JAIME,Don't.CERSEI kisses JAIME
JAIME,What are you doing?  No one can see us like this ?
CERSEI,I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  I'll do as I please.CERSEI walks over and opens the door.  A messenger looks in and sees JAIME in the bed.
MESSENGER,Forgive me
CERSEI,Good.  And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.
MESSENGER,At once
TYCHO,No
TYCHO,My condolences
CERSEI,The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.
TYCHO,Condolences and congratulations.  You've become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms.  That's quite an accomplishment.  The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law.
CERSEI,The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.
TYCHO,Indeed.  But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.
CERSEI,The Iron Bank wants its gold back.
TYCHO,Your father never minced words either.  But
CERSEI,And we both know gold wins wars.  Your vaults are empty.  Your late husband's profligacy saw to that.
TYCHO,Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies.  You're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.
CERSEI,And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.
TYCHO,We don't make bets.  We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.
CERSEI,That's a fancy way of saying bet.  The war has already begun.  I've drawn first blood.  I decapitated the Dornish snake.  My armada owns the Narrow Sea.
TYCHO,Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.
CERSEI,Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.
TYCHO,For now.  Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons.  How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?
CERSEI,Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think.  Now
TYCHO,The slave trade has entered a down turn
CERSEI,From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch.  In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?TYCHO begins to speak but CERSEI cuts him off.
CERSEI,The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts.  Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?
TYCHO,Your father's daughter indeed.
CERSEI,Give me a fortnight.  Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.CUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFSTYRION is walking along the cliffs and sees JON standing alone looking out into the ocean.  TYRION approaches JON and speaks to him.
TYRION,I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.  You're making it difficult.  You look a lot better brooding than I do.  You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.
JON,I'm a prisoner on this island.
TYRION,I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island.  You're free to walk the castle
JON,Except to my ship.  They took my ship.
TYRION,I wouldn't say we took your ship.
JON,I'm not playing word games with you.  The dead are coming for us all.
TYRION,Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies
JON,It's hard for me to fathom.  It really is.  If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --JON pauses and hangs his head.
JON,You probably don't believe me.
TYRION,I do actually.
JON,You didn't before.  Grumpkins and snarks you called them.  Do you remember?  You said it was all nonsense.
TYRION,It was all nonsense.  Everybody knew it.  But then Mormont saw them and you saw them
JON,How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?
TYRION,Good question.
JON,I know it's a good question.  I'm looking for an answer.
TYRION,People's minds aren't made for problems that large.  White Walkers
JON,I need to help prepare my people for what's coming.  I can't help them from here.  I'd like to leave.
TYRION,It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.
JON,Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes.  Don't go south.  Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter
TYRION,Children are not their fathers
TYRION,So do you have anything reasonable to ask?JON stops and turns back around.
JON,What do you mean?
TYRION,Maybe you are a northern fool.  I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.CUT TO: DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLEDAENERYS and TYRION are having a discussion.
DAENERYS,Dragonglass?
TYRION,Yes.  Volcanic glass
DAENERYS,Why are we talking about glass?  We just lost two of our allies.
TYRION,Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow
DAENERYS,And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?
TYRION,Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers
DAENERYS,And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?
TYRION,I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong
DAENERYS,Which wise man said this?
TYRION,I don't remember.
DAENERYS,Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?
TYRION,I would never do that...to you.  The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here.  All of his advisors would have told him not to come.  I would have told him not to come
DAENERYS,What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people?  Did you notice that?
TYRION,You must allow them their flights of fancy.  It's dreary in the north.CUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYSDAENERYS is at the bottom of the path looking out into the ocean.  Dragons are flying over the ocean and over the mountains in the distance.  JON approaches DAENERYS from the top of the stairs.
JON,Amazing thing to see.
DAENERYS,I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon.  They're both gone now.DAENERYS turns to look at JON.
DAENERYS,You lost two brothers as well?JON shakes his head.
DAENERYS,People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are.  Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.
JON,You've been talking to Tyrion?
DAENERYS,He is my Hand.
JON,He enjoys talking.
DAENERYS,We all enjoy what we're good at.
JON,I don't.DAENERYS pauses and looks at JON.
DAENERYS,You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.
JON,I never expected that you would.
DAENERYS,And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.
JON,I haven't either.
DAENERYS,I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it.  Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.
JON,Thank you.DAENERYS turns back to the ocean.
JON,So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?
DAENERYS,You better get to work
SANSA,How much do we have?
WOLKAN,4
SANSA,What does that mean?
YOHN,For the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year
SANSA,What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?
WOLKAN,I'm not entirely certain.  I'll check Maester Llewyn's records.  He kept a copy of every raven scroll.SANSA and the men walk from the upper level down into the courtyard.
SANSA,You're telling me we don't have enough food
WOLKAN,No
SANSA,We must prepare for that eventuality.  Every direction the threat comes from
YOHN,Very wise
SANSA,Maester Wolkan
SANSA,Are they covering those breastplates in leather?
YOHN,No
SANSA,Well
YOHN,They should indeed.  Pardon me
YOHN,You there
BAELISH,Command suits you.  The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.
SANSA,So they should be.
BAELISH,I know Cersei better than anyone here.  If you turn your back on her --
SANSA,You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.
BAELISH,I only meant to say --
SANSA,That the woman who murdered my mother
BAELISH,One of two things will happen.  Either the dead will defeat the living
BAELISH,Don't fight in the north or the south.  Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind.  Everyone is your enemy
GUARD,Lady Sansa
BRAN,Hello
SANSA,I wish Jon was here.
BRAN,Yes.  I need to speak to him.
SANSA,Your father's last living true born son.  You're Lord of Winterfell.
BRAN,I can never be the Lord of Winterfell.  I can never be lord of anything.  I'm the three-eyed raven.
SANSA,I don't know what that means.
BRAN,It's difficult to explain.
SANSA,Try
BRAN,It means I can see everything.  Everything that's ever happened to everyone.  Everything that's happening right now.  It's all pieces
SANSA,How do you know all of this?
BRAN,The three-eyed raven taught me.
SANSA,I thought you were the three-eyed raven.
BRAN,I told you it's difficult to explain.
SANSA,Bran --
BRAN,I'm sorry for all that's happened to you.  I'm sorry it had to happen here at our home.  It was so beautiful that night.  Snow falling just like now.  And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress.SANSA appears shaken.  She quickly stands up to leave.
SANSA,I have to go back inside
BRAN,I'll stay a bit longer.CUT TO:  CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMSARCHMAESTER MARWYN
MARWYN,Hmm.MARWYN walks around JORAH and continues to exam him.
MARWYN,Hmm.  Does it hurt?
JORAH,A bit.  Less than before.
MARWYN,The infection no longer appears to be active.JORAH sighs with relief and looks at the floor.
MARWYN,Unusual.  Unlikely.  One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment.
JORAH,I don't know anything about that.  I just started feeling better.  I assumed it was the rest that did it.SAMWELL begins nodding his head in agreement.
JORAH,And the climate.
MARWYN,The climate?  You're free to go
MARWYN,Tarley
JORAH,How bad is it?
SAMWELL,I suppose I'll find out this evening.JORAH smiles and nods at SAMWELL.   He turns around and picks up his shirt.
SAMWELL,Where will you go?JORAH puts on his shirt and begins tying it up.
JORAH,I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it.  I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could.  Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise.  The only place for me is with her.JORAH turns to face SAMWELL.
JORAH,I owe my life to her and you.
SAMWELL,Your father saved me more than once.  It's the least I could do.JORAH nods his head.
JORAH,Perhaps our paths will cross again?
SAMWELL,I hope they do.SAMWELL reaches out to shake JORAH's hand.  JORAH hesitates for a moment
MARWYN,You treated him?
SAMWELL,Yes.
MARWYN,Who told you to treat him?
SAMWELL,No one.
MARWYN,Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?
SAMWELL,I seem to remember you.
MARWYN,But you treated him anyway?
SAMWELL,I did.
MARWYN,I forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful.  Especially on someone of that age.  You could have infected yourself and others.  You could have devastated the entire Citadel.  But you didn't.  It's a meticulous
SAMWELL,I read the books and followed the instructions.MARWYN stands up and walks from behind his desk.
MARWYN,That man is alive because of you.  You should be proud.
SAMWELL,Thank you
MARWYN,Come here.MARWYN and SAMWELL walk to a table in the study.  It's covered in moldy books and scrolls.
MARWYN,All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away.  I need you to make copies of them.SAMWELL says nothing.
MARWYN,You were expecting a reward?  Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel.  You'd better get started.  Be mindful of the paper mites.  They like flesh as well.MARWYN walks out of the room to leave SAMWELL to his work.CUT TO: DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLEDAENERYS
DAENERYS,We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
VARYS,Your Grace
DAENERYS,I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.DAENERYS pauses and looks at VARYS.  VARYS looks at TYRION.
TYRION,But you'll have to go yourself.  Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place.  You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.
DAENERYS,I wouldn't be alone.  I'd have Drogon
MISSANDEI,They can still do something to you.  It only takes one arrow.
TYRION,It's too great a risk.  You're too important.DAENERYS looks down at the painted table.
DAENERYS,What about Casterly Rock?
VARYS,The Unsullied will be there soon.
MISSANDEI,And what will they face?
VARYS,A difficult situation.  They know we're coming.
TYRION,Yes.  Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister.  She will be ready.CUT TO: CASTERLY ROCKTYRION continues narrating as the castle is seen in the distance on top of some cliffs.
TYRION,No one has ever taken the rock.Lannister archers are shown on top of the battlements.  There are hundreds of ships sailing in the ocean heading to Casterly Rock.
TYRION,The Lannister army is still the army my father built.  Well trained and well provisioned.  10
TYRION,They will be ready.A man is running across the battlements stocking arrows for the archers.  Men are stacking rocks along the wall to throw down at the invaders.
MAN,Draw!  Loose!Archers loose a set of arrows down onto rows of Unsullied marching on the walls of the castle.
TYRION,The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.Unsullied are being killed by incoming arrows.  Unsullied soldiers begin setting up ladders to scale the battlements.  The Lannister army throws rocks from the top of the wall.
TYRION,The fight up the walls will be hard.  We'll be at a disadvantage.  Many men will die.The archers are easily defending the castle and killing Unsullied soldiers.CUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLETYRION starts narrating a different battle plan.
TYRION,Interesting thing about my father.  He built our house up from near ruin.  He built our army.  He built Casterly Rock as we know it
TYRION,It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.The Unsullied sail into the passage.  They jump out of the boat and rush into the sewers.  GREY WORM pushes up a manhole cover and emerges into the castle.  Guards are seen running by and don't notice GREY WORM and the other Unsullied soldiers sneaking in.
TYRION,No better place for low pursuits.  Casterly Rock
TYRION,As a good friend of mine once said
TYRION,And so it begins.  They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces.  They will be outnumbered.  They will have less armor and fewer weapons.There is general mayhem as the battle rages on in the courtyard.  GREY WORM breaks from the main fight and starts climbing to the battlements.  He is disposing of men with his spear on the way.
TYRION,But as my sister's armies fights for her
UNSULLIED 1,There are none left.
GREY WORM,There are supposed to be more than this.  Many more.GREY WORM turns to look out from the battlements towards the ocean.  The Unsullied fleet is under attack from the Iron Fleet and many boats are sunk or in flames.  GREY WORM's face twists in anger.  GREY WORM steps down from the battlement and grabs a bleeding Lannister soldier.  GREY WORM begins speaking English.
GREY WORM,Where are they?  Where are the rest of the Lannisters?CUT TO:  HIGHGARDEN - FIELDSThousands of fully armored Lannister soldiers are marching towards Highgarden.  JAIME is riding his horse inspecting the lines of soldiers.  He rides over and joins BRONN
OLENNA,It's done?
JAIME,It is.
OLENNA,And now the rains weep for our whores.  Did we fight well?
JAIME,I suppose as well as can be expected.JAIME walks to the wine and pours two glasses.
OLENNA,It was never our forte.  Golden roses indeed.  Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.
JAIME,The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore.  Well
OLENNA,So you'll just let them take it?
JAIME,For now.  They won't be able to hold it.  Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships
OLENNA,And you took your army
JAIME,As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood.  There are always lessons in failures.
OLENNA,Yes.  You must be very wise by now.
JAIME,My father always said I was a slow learner.
OLENNA,If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry?  I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough.  No more learning from my mistakes
OLENNA,That was Joffrey's sword
JAIME,Widow's Wail.
OLENNA,He really was a cunt
JAIME,To you
OLENNA,You love her.  You really do love her.  You poor fool.  She'll be the end of you.
JAIME,Possibly.  Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though
OLENNA,What better person to discuss it with?  What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room?  But perhaps you're right.  If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.
JAIME,Yes
OLENNA,She's a disease.  I regret my role in spreading it.  You will too.
JAIME,I think we're done here.JAIME stands up and moves closer to OLEN.
OLENNA,How will it happen?
JAIME,Cersei had several ideas.  Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep.  Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing.  I talked her out of those.OLEN looks up at JAIME.  JAIME produces a small vial from a pouch on his belt and pops the cork off with his thumb.  He pours the contents of the vial into one of the glasses of wine and slides it in front of OLEN.
OLENNA,Will there be pain?
JAIME,No.  I made sure of that.
OLENNA,That's good.OLEN reaches out and takes the wine.  She drinks the entire cup.  She looks back to JAIME.
OLENNA,I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck
JAIME,Halt that wagon!
BRONN,You just won the biggest prize in the world.  What could you possibly have to be upset about?  Come on.  You can tell me.  Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?
JAIME,I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.
BRONN,There is no more High Septon.
JAIME,No
BRONN,There is still the question of my prize.
JAIME,That's a lot of money I just gave you.
BRONN,It's not a castle.
BRONN,How about that one?  It's available.
JAIME,You don't want Highgarden.
BRONN,I beg to differ.
JAIME,We're at war.  Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in.  Besides
BRONN,Oh
JAIME,They're not mine.  The gold belongs to the Iron Bank.  We pay our debts.
BRONN,Right.  Just not to me.
JAIME,Bronn of the Blackwater
BRONN,Yes
JAIME,Stranger things have happened.
BRONN,Like what?
RANDYLL,The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons
JAIME,The current harvest?
DICKON,We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach.
JAIME,Ser Bronn
BRONN,I'm not much for shoveling weight.
JAIME,No

TYCHO,I am neither kind
CERSEI,Is on its way.  My brother is supervising its transportation himself.
TYCHO,Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed.  They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.
CERSEI,We must devise a way to raise their spirits.
TYCHO,Yes.  Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.
CERSEI,My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.
TYCHO,I see a great deal of potential in that venture.  I imagine that it would require outside investment?
CERSEI,It will indeed.  I need to expand my armies
TYCHO,I know them well.  They've helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.
CERSEI,That's good to hear.  I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.
TYCHO,Rest assured

BAELISH,The other dagger
BRAN,Do you know who this belonged to?
BAELISH,No.  That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings.  In a way
BAELISH,To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world
BAELISH,I'm sorry to have disturbed you
BRAN,I'm not Lord Stark.
MEERA,What's that?
BRAN,Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.

SANSA,You don't have to.  I know where she is.
ARYA,Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?
SANSA,Yes.
SANSA,You shouldn't have run from the guards.
ARYA,I didn't run.  You need better guards.
ARYA,It suits you
SANSA,He did.  I hope he comes back soon.  I remember how happy he was to see me.  When he sees you
ARYA,That doesn't look like him.  It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.
SANSA,Everyone who knew his face is dead.
ARYA,We're not.
ARYA,They say you killed Joffrey.  Did you?
SANSA,I wish I had.
ARYA,Me too.  I was angry when I heard someone else had done it.  However long my list got he was always first.
SANSA,Your list?
ARYA,Of people I'm going to kill.

BRAN,Littlefinger gave it to me.
ARYA,Littlefinger
SANSA,He's declared for House Stark.
SANSA,Why would he give you a dagger?
BRAN,He thought I'd want it.
SANSA,Why?
BRAN,Because it was meant to kill me.
SANSA,The cutthroat after your fall?
ARYA,Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?
BRAN,Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.
SANSA,He's not a generous man.  He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.
BRAN,It doesn't matter.

DAENERYS,It's all right.
JON,I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.
JON,So this is it
JON,There is something else I want to show your
JON,The Children of the Forest made these.
DAENERYS,When?
JON,A very long time ago.
DAENERYS,They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters.  Maybe even before there were men.
JON,No.
JON,They were here together the Children and the First Men.
DAENERYS,Doing what?  Fighting each other?
DAENERYS,They fought together against their common enemy.  Despite their differences
JON,Because the enemy is real.  It's always been real.
DAENERYS,And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?
JON,No
DAENERYS,I will fight for you.  I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.
JON,My people won't accept a southern ruler
DAENERYS,They will if their king does.  They chose you to lead them.  They chose you to protect them.  Isn't their survival more important than your pride?

DAENERYS,Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.
TYRION,Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.  We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.  Commit to the blockade of King's Landing.  We have a plan.  It's still the right plan.
DAENERYS,The right plan?  Your strategy has lost us Dorne
TYRION,If I've underestimated our enemies --
DAENERYS,Our enemies?  Your family
DAENERYS,Enough with the clever plans.
DAENERYS,I have three large dragons.  I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.
TYRION,We've discussed this.
DAENERYS,My enemies are in the Red Keep.  What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?
TYRION,A smart one.
DAENERYS,What do you think I should do?
JON,I would never presume to --
DAENERYS,I'm at war.  I'm losing.
DAENERYS,What do you think I should do?
JON,I never thought that dragons would exist again.  No one did.  The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen.  Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen.  Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.

MISSANDEI,Your name is Jon Snow
JON,I'm a bastard.  My mother and father weren't married.
DAVOS,Is the custom different in Naarth?
MISSANDEI,We don't have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.
DAVOS,The sounds liberating.
JON,Why did you leave your homeland?
MISSANDEI,I was stolen away by slavers.
JON,I'm sorry.

MISSANDEI,She bought me from my master and set me free.

MISSANDEI,I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen.  Because I believe in her.

CERSEI,They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid
JAIME,I just saw the Dothraki fight.  They'll beat any mercenary army.  They'll beat any army I've ever seen.  Killing our men wasn't war for them
CERSEI,So what do we do?  Sue for peace?  I sit on her father's throne
CERSEI,Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.
JAIME,He didn't.
CERSEI,You saw the crossbow
JAIME,I'm not talking about father.  Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.  He had nothing to do with it.
CERSEI,After all this time it still amazes me --
JAIME,It was Olenna.  She confessed before she died.
CERSEI,And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?
JAIME,After.
CERSEI,And you believed her?
JAIME,If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen?  Which one would Margerey been better able to control?  Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms?  She was telling the truth.
CERSEI,I shouldn't have listened to you.  She should have died screaming.

JON,No
DAENERYS,How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?
JON,Thousands.
DAENERYS,We both want to help people.  We can only help them from a position of strength.  Sometimes strength is terrible.  When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.

MAESTER 1,I put very little stock in it myself.  Prophecies of doom are never in short supply
MARWYN,I remember Wolkan.   A bit timid but a sharp mind.
MAESTER 1,The north has dulled many good maester's wits.  I'm not sure if it's the cold
MAESTER 1,A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes.
MARWYN,It is a bit much.  Still we ought to --
SAMWELL,Brandon Stark --
SAMWELL,-- the crippled boy.
MARWYN,Do you know him?
SAMWELL,I let him through the Wall years ago.  I saw him go beyond the wall.
MARWYN,And?
SAMWELL,Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could.  Not the Night's Watch
MAESTER 1,Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.
MARWYN,I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming.
SAMWELL,Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you.  If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it.  If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it.  And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night
MARWYN,It could be done.  And this news could be authentic.  It's possible.  It's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest.
MAESTER 1,That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples.
SAMWELL,Archmaester
MARWYN,We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification.  I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.
SAMWELL,Archmaester --
MARWYN,That will be all
MAESTER 2,It brings to mind the work of Davy Moonstone
MAESTER 1,Don't forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer.
MAESTER 1,Is he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive?
MARWYN,I'm afraid so.

TYRION,All rulers demand that people bend the knee.  It's why they're rulers.  She gave Tarley a choice.  A man who had taken up arms against her.  What else could she do?
VARYS,Not burn him alive alongside his son.
TYRION,I am her hand
VARYS,That's what I used to tell myself about her father.  I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive.  I was only a purveyor of information.
VARYS,It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy
TYRION,Daenerys is not her father.
VARYS,And she never will be... with the right counsel.  You need to find a way to make her listen.
TYRION,Who is that for?

JON,Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch.  If they make it past the wall --
VARYS,The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years.  Presumably --
JON,I need to go home.
DAENERYS,You said you don't have enough men.
JON,We'll fight with the men we have.  Unless you'll join us.
DAENERYS,And give the country to Cersei?  As soon as I march away she marches in.
TYRION,Perhaps not.  Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children.  What if we prove her wrong?
JON,I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.
TYRION,So bring the dead to her.
DAENERYS,I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.
TYRION,We don't have to bring the whole army.  Only one soldier.
DAVOS,Is that possible?
JON,The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
TYRION,Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.
VARYS,Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.
TYRION,The only person she listens to is Jaime.  He may listen to me.
DAENERYS,And how would you get into King's Landing.
DAVOS,I can smuggle you in
DAENERYS,Well
VARYS,Fair point.  How do you propose to find one?
JORAH,With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.
JORAH,You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you.  Allow me to serve you.
JON,The free folk will help us.  They know the real north better than anyone.
DAVOS,They won't follow Ser Jorah.
JON,They won't have to.
DAVOS,You can't lead a raid beyond the wall.  You're not in the Night's Watch anymore.  You're King in the North.

JAIME,We don't have time for this.  We should be preparing the city for a siege.  The Dothraki are coming.
BRONN,All the more reason for you to train.  Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.
JAIME,I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.
BRONN,And here I am ready to train.
JAIME,Why down here?
BRONN,I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.
JAIME,Today might be the day I kill you by accident.
BRONN,Oh
BRONN,I'll leave you to it.
TYRION,I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.
TYRION,You made me look like a complete fool.  I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock
JAIME,Don't talk about our father.
TYRION,Listen to me --
JAIME,I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.
TYRION,It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.
TYRION,He was going to execute me.  He knew I was innocent.  He didn't hate me because of anything I did
JAIME,What do you want?
TYRION,Daenerys will win this war.  You're a military man.  You must know there is no way around it.  Daenerys is not her father.  She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
JAIME,You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.
TYRION,I -- I don't.  Daenerys doesn't.  Not right now anyway.  She has a more important request.

DAVOS,I looked in shops
GENDRY,Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?
DAVOS,I haven't been here in years.  Why should they recognize me?  Sometimes I hardly do.  Nothing fucks you harder than time.
DAVOS,Anybody give you any trouble?
GENDRY,Here I am arming Lannisters.  I never get a second look.  You were right.  Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.
DAVOS,Don't be so sure.  Safety is never a permanent state of affairs.  Bad things are coming.
GENDRY,You came to get me.  You want me to come with you.
DAVOS,I think you need to understand --
GENDRY,I'm ready.  Let's go.
DAVOS,You should know what you're heading into.
GENDRY,Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father?  They tried to kill me.
GENDRY,I've been getting ready.  I never knew what for
DAVOS,You might want to bring one of those swords.
GENDRY,I don't know much about swinging swords
GENDRY,-- this I know.

DAVOS,Keep your father's name to yourself.  The situation is complicated enough already.
GENDRY,Who should I say I am?
DAVOS,I told you
GUARD 1,You there.
DAVOS,No weapons
GUARD 1,Is that your boat?
DAVOS,It is.
GUARD 2,The docks are that way.
GENDRY,That they are.  I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.
DAVOS,Still five gold dragons?
GUARD 1,Are you joking?
GUARD 2,You must be even older than you look.  15.
DAVOS,15?
GUARD 1,Apiece.
DAVOS,I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.
GUARD 1,What's in the boat?
DAVOS,Not more gold.
GUARD 2,Wine?
GUARD 1,Mmm.
GUARD 2,I like wine.
GUARD 1,Or hams.
DAVOS,Come and have a look.
DAVOS,Fermented crab.
GUARD 2,What?
DAVOS,Fermented crab.  One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week.  A man thinks he's done
DAVOS,I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.
GUARD 2,Oi
DAVOS,I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.
GUARD 2,That dwarf --
GUARD 1,Where did you get that scar?
TYRION,Fish hook.  Some men you just can't teach.
GUARD 2,We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back.
DAVOS,Perhaps there's some arrangement?
GUARD 2,Arrangement?  You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei?
DAVOS,This is Gendry.
TYRION,He'll do.

JAIME,Why was QYBURN here?
CERSEI,He's Hand of the Queen.  Why are you here?
JAIME,I met with Tyrion.
CERSEI,What did our brother have to say?
JAIME,Daenerys wants to meet.
CERSEI,To discuss a surrender?
JAIME,To discuss an armistice.
CERSEI,She just won a great victory.  Why would she want a truce now?
JAIME,Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms.  Tyrion claims he'll have proof.
CERSEI,Are you going to punish him?
JAIME,Tyrion?
CERSEI,Bronn.
CERSEI,He betrayed you.  He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent.  Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?
JAIME,You let it happen.  Why?
CERSEI,I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest.  She has the numbers.  If we want to beat her we have to be clever.  We have to fight her like father would have.  Dead men
JAIME,Who will you say is the father?
CERSEI,You.
JAIME,People won't like that.
CERSEI,Do you remember what father used to say about people?
JAIME,The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
CERSEI,Never betray me again.

DAVOS,We're leaving today.  The king's got a lot on his mind.
GENDRY,I understand.

GENDRY,You don't have to worry.
DAVOS,You're just Clovis
GENDRY,Understood.
DAVOS,Begging your pardon
JON,You survived King's Landing.
DAVOS,Yet again.
JON,Your Grace
GENDRY,It's Gendry
DAVOS,He was meant to keep that to himself.
GENDRY,Our fathers trusted each other.  Why shouldn't we?
JON,I saw your father once at Winterfell.
GENDRY,I met yours in my shop.JON:  You're a lot leaner.
GENDRY,You're a lot shorter.
JON,I grew up on stories about them.
GENDRY,All I ever knew was they fought together and won.  Ser Davos told me where you're going
DAVOS,Don't be a fool.  You're not a soldier.
GENDRY,No
JON,Do you know how to use one?
JON,Well
GENDRY,I prefer a hammer.
DAVOS,He can handle himself.
JON,We could use the help.
DAVOS,As my father used to say
GENDRY,I owe you my life.  Twice over.  But if what you said is true about what's out there
DAVOS,Yeah.  Nobody mind me.  All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.

SAMWELL,It's when a man sets asside his lawful wife.
GILLY,Meynard says here that he issued an anullment for Prince Rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in Dorne.  Is that a common thing --

JON,Two.
TORMUND,And you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?
JON,Both.
TORMUND,How many men did you bring?
JON,Not enough.
TORMUND,The big woman?
JORAH,We were hoping some of your men could help.

TORMUND,They want to go beyond the Wall too.
BERIC,We don't want to go beyond the Wall
GENDRY,Don't trust them.  Don't trust any of them.
GENDRY,They're the Brotherhood.  And the last thing their Lord told them to do was sell me to a Red Witch to be murdered.
JORAH,Thoros?
JORAH,I hardly recognized you.
THOROS,Ser Jorah Mormont --
THOROS,They won't give me anything to drink down here.  I haven't been feeling like myself.
TORMUND,You're a fucking Mormont?  Like the last Lord Commander?
JORAH,He was my father.
TORMUND,He hunted us like animals.
JORAH,You returned the favor
BERIC,Here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same reason.
DAVOS,Our reasons aren't your reasons.
BERIC,It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.
BERIC,There's a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not.  We may take the steps but the Lord of Light --
SANDOR,For fuck's sake
JORAH,Don't you want to know what we're doing?

TORMUND,I've been to Winterfell.
JON,That's the north.
GENDRY,How do you live up here?  How do you keep your balls from freezing off?
TORMUND,You have to keep moving.  That's the secret.  Walking is good
JON,There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.
TORMUND,We have to make due with what we've got.
TORMUND,This one is maybe not so smart.
JON,Davos says he is a strong fighter.
TORMUND,Good.  That's more important than being smart.
TORMUND,Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead.  So
JON,She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
TORMUND,You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling.  Mance Rayder was a great man
THOROS,Are you still mad at us
GENDRY,You sold me to a witch.
THOROS,Priestess.  I'll admit
BERIC,We're fighting a great war.  Wars cost money.
GENDRY,I wanted to be one of you.  I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave.  Do you know what she did to me?  She strapped me down on a bed
SANDOR,Sounds all right so far.
GENDRY,-- and put leeches on me.
SANDOR,Was she naked too?
THOROS,She needed your blood.
GENDRY,Yes. Thank you.  I know that.
SANDOR,It could have been worse.
GENDRY,She wanted to kill me.  They would have killed me if it wasn't for Davos --
SANDOR,But they didn't
GENDRY,I'm not whinging.
SANDOR,Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.  That's whinging.
SANDOR,This one's been killed six times.  You don't hear him bitching about it.
THOROS,Good lad.
JON,The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.
JORAH,He was a good man.  He deserved a better son.  Were you with him at the end?
JON,I was a prisoner of the Wildlings.  But we avenged him.  I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.
JORAH,I can't think of a worse way for him to go.  The Night's Watch was his life.  He would have died to protect every one of those men
JON,I hate that he died that way.  My father was the most honorable man I ever met.  He was good all the way through.  And he died on the executioner's block.
JORAH,Your father wanted to execute me.
JON,I heard.
JORAH,He was in the right of course.  It didn't make me hate him any less.
JON,I'm glad he didn't capture you.
JORAH,Me too.
JON,Your father gave me this sword.  He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf
JON,Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.
JON,But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries.  It's not right for me to have it.
JORAH,He gave it to you.
JON,I'm not his son.
JORAH,I brought shame to my house.  I broke my father's heart.
JORAH,I forfeited the right to claim this sword.  It's yours.  May it serve you well and your children after you.
CUT TO,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD
ARYA,Father used to watch us from up here.  He wouldn't say much.  You probably don't remember.  You were inside knitting all the time.
SANSA,I remember.
ARYA,One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick.  I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground.  Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw.  There was one arrow in the target.  There was no one around
ARYA,I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me.  I knew what I was doing was against the rules.  But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong.  The rules were wrong.  I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it.  Now he's dead.  Killed by the Lannisters with your help.
SANSA,What?
ARYA,"That's your pretty handwriting.  Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you.  ""Robb"
SANSA,You don't have to read it.  I remember.
ARYA,"""Father has been charged with treason.  He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne.  The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort.  I beg you"
SANSA,They forced me to do it.
ARYA,Did they.  With a knife at your throat?  Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?
SANSA,You don't know what it was like.  I was a child.
ARYA,So was I.  I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.
SANSA,They told me it was the only way to save father.
ARYA,And you were stupid enough to believe them.  I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block.  I remember the pretty dress you were wearing.  I remember the fancy way you did your hair.
SANSA,You were there?
ARYA,I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.
SANSA,And what did you do?  Did you come running to the rescue?  Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?
ARYA,I wanted to.
SANSA,But you didn't.  Just like me.
ARYA,I didn't betray him.  I didn't betray Robb.  I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.
SANSA,You should be on your knees thanking me.  We're standing in Winterfell again because of me.  You didn't win it back.  Jon didn't win it back.  He lost the Battle of the Bastards.  The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where
ARYA,I was training.
SANSA,Training.  Well
ARYA,Oh
SANSA,You never would have survived what I survived.
ARYA,I guess we'll never know.
SANSA,What are you doing to do with that letter.
ARYA,I don't know yet.
SANSA,Who did you show it to?  Where did you find it?
ARYA,You're scared
SANSA,Arya --
ARYA,Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry?  No.  That's not Jon.  He'll understand.  You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.
SANSA,Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting?  This is exactly what she wants.  This is what she's always wanted
ARYA,The northern lords will read it.  They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding.  What would little Lyanna Mormont say?  She's younger than you were when you wrote this.  Are you going to say
SANSA,You're angry.  Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.
ARYA,Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things.  I'll go with anger.

TORMUND,Gingers are beautiful.  We are kissed by fire.  Just like you.
SANDOR,Don't point your fucking finger at me.
TORMUND,Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?
SANDOR,I didn't trip.  I was pushed.
TORMUND,Ever since you've been mean.
SANDOR,Will you fuck off?
TORMUND,I don't think you're truly mean.  You have sad eyes.
SANDOR,Do you want to suck my dick?  Is that it?
TORMUND,Dick?
SANDOR,Cock.
TORMUND,Ah.  Dick.  I like it.
SANDOR,I bet you do.
TORMUND,Nope.  It's pussy for me.  I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell.  If I ever get back there.  Yellow hair.  Blue eyes.  Tallest woman you've ever seen.  Almost as tall as you.
SANDOR,Brienne of Tarth.
TORMUND,You know her?
SANDOR,You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?
TORMUND,Well
SANDOR,How does she look at you?  Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?
TORMUND,You do know her.
SANDOR,We've met.
TORMUND,I want to make babies with her.  Think of the great big monsters.  They'd conquer the world.
SANDOR,How did a mad fucker like you live this long?
TORMUND,I'm good at killing people.
BERIC,You don't much look like him.
JON,Who's that?
BERIC,Your father.  I suppose you favor your mother.
JON,You knew him?
BERIC,Of course I did.  When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain.  Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back.  Thoros has brought me back six times.  We both serve the same lord.
JON,I serve the north.
BERIC,The north didn't raise you from the dead.
JON,The lord of light never spoke to me.  I don't know anything about him.  I don't know what he wants from me.
BERIC,He wants you alive.
JON,Why?
BERIC,I don't know.
JON,That's all anyone can tell me
BERIC,I think about that all the time.  I don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing.  We're soldiers.  We have to know what we're fighting for.  I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.
JON,So what are you fighting for?
BERIC,Life.  Death is the enemy.  The first enemy and the last.
JON,But we all die.
BERIC,The enemy always wins.  And we still need to fight him.  That's all I know.  You and I wont find much joy while we're here.  But we can keep others alive.  We can defend those who can't defend themselves.
JON,"""I am the shield that guards the realms of men."""
BERIC,Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that.  Maybe that's enough.
JON,Aye.  Maybe that's enough.
SANDOR,That's what I saw in the fire.
SANDOR,A mountain like an arrowhead.
